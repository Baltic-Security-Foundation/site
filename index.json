[{"categories":["Geopolitics"],"contents":"The Belarusian elections occurred last Sunday, August 9th, and pitted incumbent president Alexander Lukashenko against political outsider Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. For what was supposed to be another easy campaign in Lukashenko’s winning streak, the protests leading up, and following the elections have sparked internal turmoil in Belarus.\nThe Belarusian government now faces its biggest crisis in 26 years, as protests and police violence sweep the capital and the opposition increases their demands. Svetlana made headlights again after contesting the election results and then leaving the country under threat from the KGB.\nThe internal unrest in Belarus also worries international observers, as the country has recently feuded with Russia - its biggest ally and possibly biggest threat - arresting 32 Russian mercenaries and placing troops at Russia’s border.\nLukashenko infamously quipped that “the country is not ready for a female president”, but it appears he does not believe the country is ready for another president at all. The following months may radically change the region, so what can be expected for the future of Belarus?\nThe Lukashenko Ideology President Alexander Lukashenko. Credits to Reuters.\nAlexander Lukashenko, sometimes called by western observers as the “Last Dictator of Europe”, is a former kolkhoz (Soviet collective farm) director. He was elected Deputy Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus in 1990, gaining a reputation as a young anti-corruption crusader.\nLukashenko contrasted sharply with his political opponents: he was a young, dedicated, and strong man that could usher a new era for Belarus, but at the same time he refused to embrace market capitalism and the wave of liberalism. He was the figure that could protect Belarus from the social upheaval that engulfed other post-soviet republics.\nHe was elected in 1994 and is Belarus’ first and, to date, only president. Soon after taking power, he brought back much Soviet-era symbolism and institutional power. Lukashenko reverted the national flag to a variation of the soviet one, restored Russian as an official language, abolished local elections, and limited the right to buy or sell farmland. His constitutional reforms gave the president unparalleled political power, with a massive police apparatus - still called the KGB.\nCompared to the Baltic States, which radically modernized their economies and joined the EU shortly after re-independence. The Baltics, however, experienced enormous growth in poverty, as soviet factories were closed and the population emigrated to other EU countries. Belarus lagged along with other post-Soviet economies. GPD, Economic Growth, and Quality of Life in Belarus resemble their final Soviet years.\nGDP per Capita (PPP) in post-soviet economies based on the International Monetary Fund\u0026rsquo;s World Economic Outlook (WEO) Database, October 2015 Edition, by Heycci.\nUnder his rule, the Belarusians didn’t lose their jobs after independence. However, its slow, incomplete, transition to capitalism also kept industries under semi-government control, reducing poverty - which is estimated to be 0.8%, a figure smaller than any of its post-soviet friends. This slow but stable growth made Lukashenko a popular figure amongst workers and farmers.\nPoverty rates in post-soviet economies. Credits to Marc Champion and Aliaksandr Kudrytski.\nBut, by keeping the soviet structure of government to stabilize the economy came at the cost of liberty. The reduction of poverty meant it was necessary to tightly control the country, and therefore, it was necessary to suppress opposition and change. Suppressing opposition and change meant controlling the country, and the cycle continued.\nToday, Belarus not only has poor dynamism in the economy but also poor political pluralism. Lukashenko’s policies are often described as “stale and stable”, the country has improved very little since 1991, but by avoiding the economic and political chaos of Ukraine or poverty rates of the Baltics he gained the loyalty of the working class, older generations, and government officials. His decisions, however, sidelined the new, growing middle class.\nBela-Russia Lukashenko’s refusal to change comes at the cost of geopolitics. By prohibiting a dynamic, market-oriented market, the economy remains completely tied to Russia, which buys almost half of all Belarus’ exports. The country also is heavily dependent on Russian trade subsidizes, such as oil (for which it pays 80% of the international prices) and natural gas (for which it pays half the market price).\nRussia controls such soft power over Belarus that it could create a crisis by stanching economic trade. In 2020 New Year’s Eve, as a backlash for not supporting integration with Russia, the Kremlin cut oil exports for 5 days, creating a shortage of oil and energy in Belarus.\nBelarus kept itself in Russia’s sphere of influence as a way to appease this giant power, going so far as proclaiming the “Union State of Russia and Belarus”, one of the many post-soviet webs of trade and foreign relations. Like Soviet control of Finnish foreign policy in the cold war (described as “Finlandization”), Lukashenko complied in some things and pushed back on others, trying to maintain his balance in this tightrope.\nRelations of the supranational organizations in the post-soviet shere, by Aris Katsaris\nLukashenko’s good economic relations with Russia kept the country from avoiding the Russian sanctions, political interference, and territorial dismemberment that befell countries like Ukraine and Georgia. But as a result of the Russian economic downturn that began in 2014, planned tax changes will make the country pay full price for Russian commodities by 2025.\nLukashenko’s “neutrality” is threatened, as keeping good economic relations with Russia means exchanging national sovereignty. Russia has since 2019 pushed for closer integration, control over foreign policy, and even demanded the opening Russian military bases in Belarus. Lukashenko cannot refuse the Kremlin’s offer without bringing the same punishments brought upon Ukraine or Georgia.\nBelarus also regards Russia as its only alternative to the politically liberal European Union. For trade deals, the country would have to modernize its outdated political machinery and curtail its human rights abuses to fit European standards. Its southern neighbor, Ukraine, experimented more extensively with liberal and democratic ideals and tried closer ties to the EU, suffered the consequences in form of social upheaval and armed conflict.\nThe International Players Until 1991, Belarus never had an independent state (excluding a brief moment after World War I). It sits on the frontier of the European Union, NATO, and Russia. Its location in the middle of the European Plain - a prime location for army movement - has made the region see countless wars in history.\nIt is unfair to compare Russia (a country) with the EU (an economic block) and NATO (a military alliance), but the past decade has demonstrated that the balance between the “western” sphere of influence and Russia can cause armed conflicts, such as Georgia in 2008 (NATO influence vs. Russia backed separatists) and Ukraine in 2014 (EU influence vs. Russia backed separatists). As it stands today, the three international players have the following objectives in Belarus:\nThe European Union: although the European Union appears to have the same goals as NATO, it does not. By referring to the “European Union,” this article is referring to social and cultural ideas – mainly supported by France and Germany – of liberalism and reduced political oppression. The European influence comes in the form of economic trade deals and international rulings.\nInternal bureaucracy and lack of political will make it unlikely that the EU will support Belarus in any significant form. For France and Germany, should Belarus ever fall to armed conflict, Poland still acts as a buffer zone. At most, the leading EU countries would apply sanctions on Russia, as it did in when it invaded Ukraine, but no more can be expected.\nNATO: NATO sees Belarus as a pivotal player in the region. Its central location between means Belarus can seal off the Baltic States from Europe, threaten Poland, and control northern Ukraine. Whoever controls Belarus controls whether that country is a strategic asset or a strategic liability, and if the country falls into civil strife or armed conflict, NATO’s position in eastern Europe is compromised. A mass influx of migrants, border violence, and political shockwaves would destabilize the region.\nThe military alliances of NATO and CSTO in Eastern Europe, by Stratfor.\nRussia: Russia under Putin pursues a path to restore its former geopolitical power and influence, lost after the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia fears being surrounded and isolated from Europe as NATO and the EU enlarge their spheres, taking post-soviet countries. Russia needs Belarus not only as a buffer zone but as an ally, since closing the Suwalki Gap (shown in the map above) works as a deterrence to NATO actions in the region. Russia’s soft power has since been strained by international sanctions applied in 2014 and this may force the Russian government to curtail Belarusian privileges and expect greater Belarusian cooperation.\nIn the past decade, the three international players tried to maintain the balance of power in Belarus to avoid escalation. This Realpolitik worked well under Lukashenko’s neutrality but this tightrope is being threatened as the internal politics may soon change drastically.\nThis apprehension about the future of Belarus was brought to the forefront on July 29th, when 32 Russian Private Military Contractors were arrested in Minsk. Even if their true mission was not related to Belarus (a similar event happened in 2017), the incident has raised tensions between Belarus, Russia, and NATO. Incidents like this highlight how internal or international actions might make a domino effect in the country.\nThe Elections and the Opposition The official results show the winner as Lukashenko, with 80% of the vote. Many doubts, however, were raised about the results, as Lukashenko himself admitted to changing the results in 2006.\nThe true percentage of Lukashenko is unknown, since independent opinion polls - even online surveys - are prohibited. While he certainly has a strong base of support among the elites and the older workers, he never achieved great popularity among the middle class and younger voters. For the first time, those already born in the Lukashenko-era can vote.\nHis opponent in this election was Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a former English teacher and stay-at-home mother of 2 with no experience in politics. She made her presidential bid after her husband was arrested in May 2020, for political activism. Her “outsider stance” from traditional Belarusian politics and grassroots campaign made her prominent and attracted international attention.\nThe opposition parties in Belarus exist in paper only, as leading figures and political activists have been arrested or fled the country. Svetlana was an exception since Lukashenko did not believe she could seriously challenge his reign, going as far as declaring that the country was not ready for a female president. Svetlana has since left the country and will probably not take further part in politics, but her impact is permanent.\nLukashenko’s commentaries, the government’s declared sabotage of her campaign, and her charming naivité made Svetlana a symbolic figure to the people. But Svetlana’s rise also meant the many opposition factions had to revolve around a single idea: removing Lukashenko. The protests that followed the elections are a result of the same, single, idea. This means the opposition has no agreement in even the most basic policies if they ever come to power.\nIt is possible to label the current political camps in Belarus: pro-western liberals, pro-Russian hardliners, soviet nostalgics, and the like. However, by clustering the rival political camps, we fail to see the fundamental internal working of a society like Belarus.\nCharles King, analyzing Andrei Almarik’s predictions on the fall of the Soviet Union, came to a wise conclusion: “A better way to think about political cleavages was to observe which portions of society are most threatened by change and which ones seek to hasten it—and then to imagine how states might manage the differences between the two. (\u0026hellip;) Where is the breaking point? How long can a political system seek to remake itself before triggering one of two reactions—a devastating backlash from those most threatened by change or a realization by the change-makers that their goals can no longer be realized within the institutions and ideologies of the present order?”\nIn the past 26 years, the Belarusian economy has been safeguarded from instability, the old methods of political repression are now too rusty to work and too inhuman to be ignored. Capitalism, as incomplete as it is in Belarus, has created a complex web of classes and ideas, forefronted by a young middle class. As long as Belarus had a minimal, but identifiable growth in quality of life, Belarusians could believe in the gradual change and reform.\nHowever, the economic stagnation and a disastrous coronavirus response showed how little the government can deliver. Lukashenko might further unnerve the population if the elections are proved to be rigged. The repression against the protest demonstrates that, so far, the Belarusian system cannot change. It remains to be seen if the majority of the population realizes protesting is not enough to change, and if an escalation of violence is the answer.\nFuture Scenario: Will it be like Ukraine? Lukashenko is dealing with the protests, so far, in the same manner he always dealt with political opposition: police crackdowns. While he accused the opposition of fermenting a “Maidan\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; (a reference to the violent clashes between protesters and the government in 2014 that toppled president Yanukovych in Ukraine), his KGB security forces have violently put down protesters. Lukashenko, despite wishing not to escalate the unrest, has no other way to deal with the protests.\nHe also cannot let them take power in any form, since it would mean judicial investigations against him and his government. Not only is his position as president in peril, as is his freedom. His only solution in this case would be exile in Russia, however, Moscow would not be very content in taking the man who jeopardized their efforts in the region.\nIt is still too early to predict an escalation of nation-wide protests like in Ukraine, while there is enough incentive (a violent police force and a population in uproar, organized through social media), but the particularities that led to a Maidan in Ukraine are not the same in Belarus.\nThe only way for a Ukraine-like Maidan to occur is if the factory workers and small farmers, mentioned before, decide to support the opposition, however, they still have a fresh memory of the chaos that followed Ukraine in 2014. These workers will probably choose the faithful stability of the past. Lukashenko also has a stronger base of support in the elites and government (especially the military) built over the past 26 years, with a better (and more controlled) economy - a privilege Yanukovych did not have. His KGB is bigger and more loyal than the Ukrainian Berkut.\nEven with the odds against it, if the protests in Minsk somehow grow bigger and topple Lukashenko, then the following months will be even more chaotic than 2014 due to two major factors:\nThe Opposition Factionalism: As mentioned before, the current movement has the single goal of removing Lukashenko. If he is removed, the different factions will divide and struggle for power. This will become clear as “western” factions of the opposition will pursue closer ties with NATO and EU to protect Belarus, while “Russian” factions will try to maintain the ties with Russia without Lukashenko. In Ukraine, while the opposition wanted to remove Yanukovych, they also rallied behind the failed EU-Ukraine agreement, this led to more unified “pro-western” opposition.\nLinguistic and Ethnic differences: The linguistic and ethnic “contrast” in Ukraine is also starkly different from Belarus. While Crimea and Eastern Ukraine formed two contiguous Russian-ethnic populations, Belarus is a mix of Belarusian and Russian regions. When Ukraine drifted apart from Russia in 2014, Russia launched operations to back ethnic Russian or Russian speaking separatists in those regions. There’s no easy way to divide Belarus between “Belarusian” or “Russian” areas. This makes small annexations like Crimea harder for Russia but surely makes a nation-wide takeover easier.\nAs said before, it is still too early to believe a Maidan would happen in Belarus. While neighbors, the same revolution in Ukraine and Belarus could have two very different outcomes. The 2020 protests may lead to major changes in Belarus, but the power struggle and restructuring of society will bring uncertain years of unemployment and economic downturn.\nThis will fracture the opposition and will make Russian backlash and interference easier. Even if an opposition government takes place, there’s a considerable chance that in the 2024 elections a “Lukashenkean” figure will run, reminding people of “the good old days” - and win.\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/the_future_of_belarus/","tags":["Belarus","NATO","Russia"],"title":"The Future of Belarus?"},{"categories":["NATO"],"contents":"In June the Trump administration announced its decision to pull 9,500 U.S. troops from Germany. The move was lambasted by those on the left and right alike, and indeed, at face value, it appeared counterintuitive. Any return to the Obama and Bush-era troop drawdown in Europe would be foolish facing a revisionist Russia. But if there is anything the keen and impartial observer should know by now about this administration, it is that it keeps its cards close to the chest, absorbing the criticism that inevitably comes and only revealing its end game down the line.\nWithin weeks, it was announced that an additional 1,000 troops could be deployed to Poland on top of the already agreed upon 1,000 from last year’s Joint Declaration on Defense Cooperation. President Trump further intimated that more could follow. Likewise, Latvia announced that it wanted and was ready to accommodate a cut of the 9,500 leaving Germany as well. Likewise, Lithuania will be receiving hundreds of U.S. troops, including a battalion sized unit this year and a company of troops in 2022. Eventually, the Baltics may see an increased U.S. troop presence as well. On July 29, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper noted that the U.S. is considering bolstering its presence in the Baltic States, and the idea is gaining traction in the U.S. defense community. It is still not yet known what will become of the remainder of these troops – where they will be going and what they will be doing there. But we are likely beginning to see a potential strategic shift by the U.S. closer to NATO’s eastern flank.\nMuch ink has been spilled about how President Trump is angry with Germany’s failure to uphold the two percent defense spending agreement in NATO. A little less has been devoted to his remarks regarding Germany’s continued pursual of Nord Stream II and closer economic relations with Russia. All of these political/diplomatic messages matter, to be sure, but what of the strategic picture? In the event of conflict, it will matter less why the troops are where they are, and more that they are where they are. The reality is this: unless Poland falls, Germany is not likely to be a frontline ally. Poland is.\nDuring the Cold War, West Germany was NATO’s primary Eastern boundary (Greece and Turkey also bordered the Warsaw Pact, but these zones were not as militarized). It made sense for the allies to maintain a significant military frontline presence there, facing off the Warsaw Pact. Both sides focused considerable energy on plans and preparations for invasion scenarios centered on the Fulda Gap, today in the center of reunified Germany. Today, the United States’ military presence in western Germany is far from the front line. Russian strategy tells us that this makes a difference.\nFulda Gap Deployments ca. 1985 – Creative Commons illustration by W.B. Wilson. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cold_War_Germany.png\nRussia is often viewed one of two ways: as a paranoid defender, facing off the specter of Western invasion, or as an opportunist, seeking to make gains in power where it is able. In reality, Russia is both of these at once. Its deluded fears of the West drive its desire for a buffer zone it can control in Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, as well as its desire to prevent the spread of NATO to Ukraine and Georgia. Yet, in its conflicts in Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia, there is a clear sense of opportunism. Russia attacked swiftly in times and locations where it calculated the West would not respond strongly. To this day, Moldova’s Transnistria barely registers on anyone’s foreign policy radar in the West. Russia attacked Georgia during a lame duck presidency in an election year while the U.S. was focused on Islamist terrorism. When Russia attacked Crimea, it knew the U.S. was not particularly interested in Europe, and indeed, the U.S. still naively believed a reset with Russia could be possible. For nearly six years, the United States and Europe have done little beyond economic sanctions to seriously punish Russia or help Ukraine. Indeed, France and Germany have poised themselves to give Russia what it wants out of the protracted conflict in the Donbass with the Steinmeier Formula.\nIn each of these cases, the Kremlin saw an opportunity to maintain its sphere of control through protracted armed conflict. But ultimately the strongest piece of evidence that Russia views conventional conflict primarily through the lens of opportunity is this: Russia invests most of its military resources towards offensive capabilities and tends to see purely defensive capabilities as cost prohibitive. This is further underscored by comments by Valeriy Gerasimov, Chief of the Russian General Staff, in a March 2019 speech. He emphasized that Russia sees deterrence through the lens of preemptive strike, designed to seize the initiative to destroy the enemy before it can take the initiative to launch its own attack.\nThis line of thinking can also be seen in Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy, in which the Kremlin seeks to destabilize and neutralize perceived threats from the West, without having to fight a conventional conflict. Strategically, Russia understands that it cannot defeat NATO in the long run in conventional war. Without wearing NATO down beforehand, setting up a fait accompli, or pursuing an “escalate to deescalate” nuclear strategy, Russia does not have the resources to defeat NATO in personnel, money, or equipment. Thus, it takes the initiative to wage asymmetric conflict in the grey zone in order to weaken NATO while economizing the use of force.\nTaking Russia’s interestingly offensive deterrence strategy into perspective, NATO must recognize the need to deny Russia any opportunity for military action against member states along the Eastern Flank. As a result, a more forward presence is required than the current status quo. Facing renewed great power competition, and knowing that Russia clearly rejects the principles of the post-Cold War order, NATO should be prepared for the need to rapidly respond to a crisis in the east. For now, the threat has remained fairly low, but ensuring that Russia understands it cannot make a preemptive strike on the Baltics, Poland, or any other NATO member is critical.\nMany have suggested that a more forward posture could provoke a desperate Russia, resulting in the escalation of conflict. What we must understand, however, is that the conflict is already ongoing and is in a state of continuously fluctuating intensity. By deploying troops and equipment further east, the U.S. and NATO can simultaneously be prepared for a more rapid response to ensure no fait accompli can be achieved while signaling to Russia that the cost of aggression will be too high.\nSource: U.S. Embassy Poland https://pl.usembassy.gov/nato_us/\nThus, moving troops from Germany to Poland makes strategic sense, regardless of outwardly stated objectives. It will be potentially costly, yes, but if the United States and NATO want to prevent a fait accompli in the Baltics, positioning troops and equipment in closer proximity to the Suwałki Gap (on the Polish-Lithuanian border) is crucial for the allies to come aid the Baltics quickly and prevent Russia from isolating them. The key to success in this, however, is a combination of clear strategic thinking at the upper levels and clear messaging to Russia. NATO should seek to put forth not necessarily the greatest number of troops, but the troops and equipment best suited for rapid response as a first wave into the Baltic theater, allowing for a second wave to follow from bases in Germany and beyond. Ideally, this should not involve any significant troop reduction in Europe as a whole; indeed, it may be better to increase the number of troops there. However, the numbers themselves ultimately matter less than the capabilities NATO possesses.\nMuch remains to be seen with respect to how many troops will be deploying further east. How many will go to Poland? Will Latvia receive any of the troops it wants? What kinds of capabilities will the U.S. focus on sending eastward? Whether or not this turns out to be good policy largely hinges on the answers to these questions. Do not expect answers soon, but keep observing. The U.S. may not be washing its hands of Europe after all. In fact, it is probably renewing its focus – this time to the east.\nCover Photo: U.S. President Donald Trump holds a joint news conference with Poland\u0026rsquo;s President Andrzej Duda in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, DC, June 24, 2020.

Though not as grandiose in scale as a May 3rd article in Izvestia would suggest, the exercises do demonstrate that Russia is working to practice its maritime capabilities. The main events of the exercises centered around what may have been two amphibious landing drills and also featured anti-aircraft and anti-submarine drills, simulated naval missile attacks, simulated aerial attacks on naval vessels, and mine-laying and mine-clearing exercises. The possibility of two amphibious landing drills aside, much of the events of late April would appear fairly routine; however, they underscore the Baltic States’ need for improvements in maritime capabilities to deter and defend against Russian aggression from the sea.\nLast September, Baltic Security Foundation published an article highlighting the deficiencies in the Baltic States’ maritime capabilities. Over the decades since re-independence, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all placed the greatest emphasis on a land-based deterrence strategy, neglecting the maritime domain. As a result, they have had no clarity in maritime strategy and have made little progress towards being able to effectively secure their coasts. They lack critical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and do not have 24/7 shared situational awareness at sea. They lack the ability to prevent Russian power projection into their territorial waters, port facilities, exclusive economic zones, or other littoral areas, and they cannot prevent Russia from temporarily taking control of these areas. Furthermore, much of their critical infrastructure is within the maritime domain, from undersea communications cables to gas interconnectors and onshore facilities such as the Klaipėda LNG terminal. These are poorly guarded, if at all, and are vulnerable to attack.\nMeanwhile, Russian capabilities are not overly impressive either, compared with say, the U.S. or British navies, but Russia’s Baltic Sea Fleet is certainly capable of maintaining the status quo, harassment, grey-zone operations, and surprise offensive action. Given the Baltic States’ lack of preparedness to prevent such actions, this condition suits the Russians just fine. In the event of aggression, Russia can still easily marry the capabilities it has at sea, say for example surprise offensive action in the form of an amphibious landing, with its capabilities on land to attack from multiple angles. Further, Russian anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities and the fact that the Baltic Sea is well-suited for mine warfare will complicate NATO reinforcement by sea.\nAs alluded to earlier, perhaps the most curious part of the Kaliningrad exercises is the two amphibious landing drills. Because of the shallow waters along the coasts, and because these coastlines are not well marked in the Baltic States, amphibious landings are rather difficult to pull off quickly, reducing their effectiveness. But, with quality intelligence on the seabed and coastal geography, they can be done. Further, if Russia can take control of any of the many islands that channel naval traffic into narrow lanes, it can more effectively cut off those lanes to others should it desire. Though amphibious landings can have defensive uses for reinforcement and supply, their primary purpose is offensive, either to invade or to push an invader back. As Russia has long been aggressive in its use of grey-zone operations in the Baltic Sea, it should be no surprise that Russia understands the limitations of other Baltic Sea states’ capabilities in the maritime domain. Nor should it be a surprise that it seeks to exploit them. If Russia were to decide to attack from multiple angles, it is reasonable that it should seek to perfect its amphibious capabilities in Kaliningrad, which is a key component of the Baltic operational environment.\nIf indeed Russia did practice amphibious landings twice in late April, as the Russian Defense Ministry website suggests, then this should give some insight into Russian strategic thinking in the Baltic Sea theater. Even without this curiosity, these exercises would be a reminder that the maritime domain contains critical weaknesses for the Baltic States which need to be addressed, not the least of which are the lack of ISR capabilities and the vulnerability of critical infrastructures which can be exploited to disrupt communications and energy supply and destabilize society. But now that we have seen these rehearsals, we must further take into consideration the possibility of attacks from the sea as well as over land. As such, this underscores the need for a coherent naval strategy among the three Baltic States and their NATO allies, as well as greater cooperation in situational awareness with Sweden and Finland. Should Russian naval exercises continue to put such emphasis on amphibious landings, this will be a clear indicator that Russia intends to put this strategy to use in theater. It is time to take the maritime domain seriously.\nCover Photo: Amphibious landing exercises in Kaliningrad Oblast, April 21 (Source: mil.ru, accessed via the Jamestown Foundation, https://jamestown.org/program/recent-military-exercises-in-kaliningrad-oblast-a-miniature-zapad/)\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/military_exercises_in_kaliningrad_highlight_maritime_threats/","tags":["Russia","Kaliningrad","Military Exercises"],"title":"Military Exercises in Kaliningrad Highlight Maritime Threats"},{"categories":["Cooperation"],"contents":"Each year, Estonia hosts Spring Storm (Kevadtorm), bringing together forces from all across NATO to conduct field and live-fire exercises. Though smaller in scale and participation due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year’s exercises concluded successfully last week. Spring Storm demonstrates Estonia and its allies’ commitment to ensuring readiness in case of attack, contributing to the credibility of NATO’s deterrence posture on the Eastern Flank.\nMilitary exercises are crucial for training and readiness purposes, as new conscripts/recruits and reservists have an opportunity to train alongside active duty personnel. Likewise, these exercises, if put together well, provide insight into the particular advantages and disadvantages the battle space provides while also forcing organizers to think critically about realistic battle scenarios. In turn, this should inform decisions on strengths and weaknesses and help decision makers strategize procurements and formulate better response plans.\nExercises also perform a critical deterrent role. A more prepared military force is a more difficult force to defeat, and therefore less enticing to attack. In a Baltic scenario, this is even more pronounced as the defenders will be a multinational force, presenting unique challenges for command and operations. Thus, NATO must be prepared to overcome these hurdles, and this can only be done through strategic planning and extensive practice putting plans into action. The more NATO is prepared to respond in a quick and coordinated manner, the better its deterrent posture will be.\nThough reduced to about a third of its scale this year, participants in Spring Storm included the United Kingdom, Denmark, the United States, the enhanced forward presence (eFP) battle group stationed in Estonia, and, of course, the Estonian Defence Forces (EDF). The Estonian Cyber Command, Air Force, and Military Police also took part in the exercises. During the field exercises at the first half of Spring Storm, the NATO allied battle group performed a red-teaming role as the enemy force. The American contribution consisted of two B-1 heavy bombers making the trip to Estonia from the continental United States as part of a 24-hour mission to practice rapid crisis response. British, Danish, and Estonian troops saw the bulk of the action this year, which largely focused on woodland infantry tactics and featured 150 units of military vehicles and equipment. The focus on woodland infantry tactics here is critical, as aside from urban scenarios in the north, infantry and combined arms operations in Estonia’s dense forests are the most likely forms of action on the ground that would be seen in the Estonian theater.\nPhoto credit: Ardi Hallismaa, accessed via ERR.ee\nThough reservists were unfortunately (and probably reasonably) unable to attend this year’s exercises, Spring Storm provided crucial training for new Estonian conscripts alongside their active duty counterparts. In order to be effective, conscripts must have training and experience. Otherwise, they may become a liability rather than a strength. As with any learned skills, military tactics and even the use of military equipment requires practice. Interoperability and the ability to effectively command multinational forces takes practice. Logistics for multinational forces in challenging geography take practice. Spring Storm demonstrates that Estonia takes its security seriously enough to train even now, albeit in a limited capacity. In turn, this willingness demonstrates to Russia that Estonia intends not to be easy pickings, and allied participation signals NATO members’ commitment to their allies’ defense.\nCover Photo: Danish troops participating in Spring Storm.

This will provide another moderate boost to the credibility of Estonia’s deterrent posture. These kinds of smaller procurements are an important part of the broader effort to build up a credible defense in case of Russian aggression and to signal that the risk outweighs the reward for attacking the Baltic States.\nYet, the numbers on this procurement highlight that while the region is perhaps best viewed as a single battle space, and while the three countries are stronger when they work together, each has different concerns based on individual characteristics. For Estonia, large scale tank warfare is not as reasonable a concern as it is for Lithuania. Here, geography plays a key role in determining how highly each state should prioritize anti-tank capabilities.\nFor Estonia, the primary concern for tank warfare will be along highways and in urban centers. Most likely this will be centered along the Narva-Rakvere-Tallinn route. But, in this environment, tanks will likely have less of an impact, as they are not well suited to fighting in built-up areas with limited space. Likewise, tanks are more vulnerable to anti-tank defenses in such environments. For Estonia, the forests, wetlands, and various hilly areas leave little open room for tanks to maneuver, pushing them to other areas where they will likely only play a supporting role.\nSource: CIA World Factbook 2011, created by Wikipedia user Radom1967 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0\nThough flatter, Latvia is just heavily forested as Estonia. For it, the primary concerns will be along highways, urban areas, and in the open fields of Zemgale. Parts of Latgale to the southeast may also be suitable for tank action. In Vidzeme, dense forests make the region unsuitable for tank warfare, and along the coast in the north, wetlands present an obstacle to tanks, pushing them to the road. This continues in Estonia, leaving tanks limited in their usefulness to the north. In February of 2018, Latvia signed a €108 million deal with EuroSpike for Spike anti-tank missiles. These missiles will also be installed on Latvia’s CVR(T) vehicles. For Latvia, the primary concern is to the south and southeast and along the Via Baltica highway to Rīga. But, unless an attack were launched in Latgale from within Belarus or Russia, Latvia’s chances of seeing tank warfare are largely dependent on Russian tanks’ success or failure in Lithuania.\nFor Lithuania, tank warfare is a very real and likely threat. Of the three Baltic countries, it has the longest ongoing cooperation with the United States on anti-tank missile procurements going back to 2002, and in February of last year, Lithuania purchased an additional $20 million in Javelin missiles. The country has far less forest cover compared with the other two, and is largely flat in the central lowlands. Open fields provide the kind of maneuverability that tanks need to be effective. But, to the southeast, which would be the most likely approach for Russian tanks, the hills around Vilnius favor defense. Thus, NATO needs to be prepared in order to prevent the Russians from getting past these hills to the lowlands around Kaunas. At Kaunas, logistics overland via the Suwałki Gap could be cut off and the Russians could connect their supply lines to Kaliningrad.\nRussia maintains numerical superiority in tanks compared to NATO. Furthermore, Russian tanks are lighter weight than British or American tanks. For the Russians, tank divisions are a key strength, and as such will be used in the Baltic theater in the event of war, even though the theater as a whole is not well suited for them. Thus, they will likely seek to leverage that strength where it is most useful in Lithuania. For NATO and each of the three Baltic states themselves, anti-tank missiles, be they Javelins, Spikes, or Carl Gustavs, are a critical leveling force against Russia. Indeed, anti-tank capabilities will be critical for maintaining an open supply line along the Via Baltica until NATO can get its own tanks into the theater. Even then, anti-tank missiles will be a crucial component of NATO’s countermeasures against Russian forces.\nWith all this in mind, the Baltics should strategize which procurements should be made jointly, and which should be based on individual circumstances. The military and political leadership need to be thinking critically about individual strengths and weaknesses, both in capabilities and in geography. Procurements should be tailored to strategy, and should not be done without considering the forces, factors, and drivers within individual countries alongside the region as a whole. Here, intelligence and information sharing are also critical to developing a coherent strategy and defensive posture. In order to deter Russian attack, defensive abilities must be credible. In order for the Baltics to have more than just a “porcupine” defense, there needs to be more strategic and practical thinking from the top down. With this kind of coordinated effort, NATO could come in as defenders, rather than liberators. Without it, war will be much longer, and much more painful.\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/tank_warfare_baltics/","tags":["US","Estonia"],"title":"Javelin Deliveries and the Prospects of Tank Warfare in the Baltics"},{"categories":["Cooperation"],"contents":"Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States would commit up to $1 Billion in support for the Three Seas Initiative. In so doing, Congress and the administration are providing much needed assistance toward developing the economic and security infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe. This initiative, launched in 2015 by the Polish and Croatian presidents, aims to make Central Europe a “backbone of European resilience,” in the words of Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. If successful, the initiative will lead both to greater economic prosperity and interconnectedness with the rest of Europe, and will undercut Russian and Chinese pressure and influence.\nMore specifically, the Three Seas Initiative will correct infrastructural imbalance which runs on an almost entirely east-west axis. Old pipelines and highways primarily run east-west throughout Central Europe, once bringing Soviet oil and gas to Europe, and continuing to foster Europe’s reliance on Russian energy. By creating a north-south infrastructural axis, the Three Seas Initiative will break up what was once a Soviet tool of control and subjugation in Central Europe and support the development of energy, transportation, and even digital infrastructure in the region. This will create a more interconnected Europe, and a more self-sufficient Europe, or at very least a Europe with greater diversification of sources for all commodities.\nOne such project seeks to build a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal in Krk, Croatia, which would be connected to the existing terminals in Klaipėda, Lithuania and Świnoujście, Poland with north-south pipelines. This will reduce the reliance on Russian gas imports in the region, weakening the diplomatic leverage Russia enjoys. Also, and of particular importance to the Baltics, the Polish-Lithuanian gas interconnector (GIPL) project and synchronization of the Baltic power grid with Continental Europe are listed as priority projects. These will foster diversification of gas resources and bring the Baltic power grid out from Moscow’s control where it currently sits under the old Soviet-era BRELL Agreement. By improving energy security in the region and reducing reliance on Russian supply, the Three Seas Initiative is an investment in both collective and national defense as well as economic growth.\nA sample of Three Seas Initiative projects, plus TANAP and Nord Stream. Source: GISreportsonline.com\nIn the transportation sector, Rail Baltica is a key project for Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The project’s aim is to integrate the Baltics’ rail system with Continental Europe, and involves laying European gauge track in a north-south route from Tallinn to Warsaw, via Rīga and Kaunas and with a short connecting jaunt to Vilnius. This project will provide a rail connection to North Sea ports in Western Europe, and will reduce reliance on the highway system for cargo and freight transport. Not only will this improve the flow of goods and people in the region, but it will also change the operational landscape logistically for NATO in the event of conflict.\nIn tandem with Rail Baltica, improvements to the “Via Baltica” highway route are listed as a priority project under the Three Seas Initiative. Presently, freight transport accounts for approximately a 30 percent share of all traffic along the route, and in the case of Lithuania, 90 percent of all freight between Lithuania and the rest of Europe travels by road. Under the status quo, the road system is inadequate for demand in freight and passenger travel. Rail Baltica should alleviate some of the problem, but this corridor remains a critical artery for both commerce and defense. Upgrades, therefore, are a key interest for national security purposes as well, expediting movements of troops and supplies. Other transport projects, such as the Via Carpathia and a Baltic-Adriatic axis, will connect the Baltics to the Black Sea and Adriatic Sea, further erasing their relative isolation.\nFinally, with regard to digital infrastructure, the Three Seas Initiative includes projects on digital trade, research collaboration, and an ambitious plan to link communications infrastructure, fiber optics, and eventually 5G technology infrastructure, dubbed the “Three Seas Digital Highway.” 5G infrastructure is a major issue at stake here, as the Chinese are key competitors in the game, and there is grave concern that Chinese 5G systems will ultimately serve as tools of espionage and subversion. As such, investing in telecommunications and 5G infrastructure without going to the Chinese regime to buy it is prudent to protect security in the cyber-domain across the region.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the U.S. would pledge up to $1B for the Three Seas Initiative at the Münich Security Conference, February 2020. Photo Source: Atlantic Council, via Reuters.\nThe Three Seas Initiative consists of twelve members: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania. All twelve are EU members, and with the exception of Austria, each are part of NATO as well. From an American perspective, the initiative is an extremely positive development. As Atlantic Council’s Ian Brzezinski points out, supporting the Three Seas Initiative falls squarely within current American strategy, “[providing] justified support for some of America’s closest allies,” “[reinforcing] Central European efforts to counter malign Russian and Chinese pressure and influence,” and providing tangible return on investment for Washington’s foreign policy objectives in the region. Early on, Washington’s enthusiastic support for the project led to skepticism from some Western European EU members, but these have also come on board as well. And with regard to the EU, Austria is a key player from the perspective of the United States and the allies on NATO’s Eastern Flank. By joining the project, Austria is positioning itself to reduce dependence on Russia for energy and to increase its economic connections to European states in the East. This changes the balance of diplomatic leverage in Vienna, and will have an impact on positions it takes within the EU. Another friendly voice in EU institutions will certainly be welcome for members such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.\nBy connecting Central and Eastern Europe along a north-south axis, the Three Seas Initiative will enhance security and end a legacy of Soviet subjugation that still effects Europe today. It is a step in the right direction for ensuring stability, prosperity, and freedom for posterity. In short, it is a no-brainer for its member states and the U.S. alike.\nCover Photo: Three Seas Initiative member states.

Given that these two countries have a long tradition of close cooperation in military affairs, this seems fairly mundane. But these exercises were highly unusual, as Finland’s FNS Uusimaa took orders from Swedish naval command, and Sweden’s HMS Helsingborg received orders from Finland’s command center in Turku. This was the first time in the history of Finnish-Swedish naval cooperation that ships took orders from the opposite country’s command. While interoperability continues to be a buzzword throughout the Baltic Sea Region as countries prepare for scenarios of Russian aggression, switching commands remains uncommon, and indeed, questions about command structure abound.\nWhat, then, is the added value for this exercise? Anders Åkermark, representing the Swedish Naval Operations department, was quoted by News Now Finland saying, “it increases the credibility of both countries’ naval forces if we can lead each other’s vessels when needed and exchange information about the maritime situation.” This also parallels the idea that has been floating around of joint Finnish-Swedish brigades. In each case, Finland and Sweden have determined that pooling their resources will make their defenses more credible, deterring Russian attack.\nIn all maritime issues in the Baltic Sea Region, small countries’ limitations in manpower and financial resources present a key weakness. Even Finland and Sweden face the manpower gap, underscoring why both countries would seek to increase operability even so far as being able to take orders from the opposite command. The two, though they have long had amicable relations with NATO, are growing ever closer to the alliance and increasing cooperation with it. In the political realm, Sweden and Finland both are seeing a shift in attitude toward NATO membership as well. If Finland and Sweden were to join NATO, this would both facilitate cooperation on military operations throughout the Baltic Sea Region and bring the two ever closer to their partners in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\nSweden has increased cooperation with NATO in recent years. Photo source: nato.int\nIndeed, British military expert Glen Grant has argued that NATO should push for Finland and Sweden to join, as it would then legally obligate Stockholm and Helsinki to join the fight in the event of war in the Baltics. Apart from NATO, he argues, the two can be more easily cowed by Russia to stay out.\nOthers may argue that NATO accession for Finland and Sweden would be escalatory and prompt Russia to go on the attack. Though Russia would be expected to protest against NATO aggression in such an event, the reality is that NATO is a defensive alliance, and Russia’s fears are both baseless and, frankly little more that political grandstanding. Certainly Russia could use the usual line about NATO aggression as an excuse to go on the offensive, and as a tool to spin the narrative of just who started what, but it will nevertheless be a lie. Besides, in nuclear deterrence, there is the concept of “escalate to de-escalate,” raising the stake to the point where an adversary is less likely to deem the punishment worth the reward. The same applies here; two more militaries under NATO command, and all the manpower and weapons systems that go with it, will likely make Russia see merit in avoiding conventional conflict. Though hybrid warfare would likely intensify, the Baltic Sea Region is already a hotbed for such activity, and this would certainly be preferable to outright war anyhow.\nAs alluded to earlier, one of the key problems of joint operations and interoperability is the need for combatants to know just what is going on at any given moment. They need to know not only what the adversary is doing, but what their partners are doing. In order to do this, information sharing and situational awareness are critical. Throughout the Baltic Sea Region, nations are deficient in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the maritime domain. Likewise, the Baltic and Nordic countries need more flexible command and control structures and improved common coordination mechanisms to ensure the security of critical sea lines of communication and supply. These, too, will augment ISR needs, facilitating smoother operations. In all this, there is an implicit need for greater structural thinking both in national governments and among allies and strategic partners. Part and parcel of that, is the need for a cohesive and coherent strategy at the regional level to enhance and facilitate cooperation. Without structure and clearly defined roles and objectives, even the best laid plans descend into disaster.\nSwedish naval vessel HSM Helsinborg, as seen from Finnish naval vessel Uusimaa / Credit: Finish Navy, acessed via News Now Finland_\nAll this brings up yet another question: how far should countries go pursuing interoperability? You can, after all, have too much of a good thing. This question needs to be considered, especially with regard to added value. If Latvia purchases an inferior, outdated tank, Lithuania should not purchase the same tank just because the two could swap mechanics. Two broken down tanks are always worse than one operational one. But, if both countries can make joint procurements of a superior tank, this would both positively impact interoperability and operational effectiveness. As in all things, there is a balance, and this balance will always be different for small countries with limited manpower and financial resources than it is for say, the United States. Strategic, structural, and tactical thinking needs to be lucid and organized, and no facet should supersede another lest it fall to the wayside.\nGreater cooperation between Finland and Sweden on military affairs reflects a newfound seriousness about defense matters in Helsinki and Stockholm. These two are an integral part of military operations in the Baltic Sea theater, and as such, this news is welcome on NATO’s northeastern flank. An increase in the deterrent capacity of both countries changes the strategic calculus in the region. Even more so, NATO accession would radically alter the operational theater, and the possibility should be given thorough consideration. But this is not the end; maritime capabilities, structures, and strategies all need serious improvements throughout the region. Without these, all the interoperability in the world will not save them. Indeed, for all its benefits, allies and partners in the region need to find the right balance on interoperability. Governments throughout the region must be willing to keep improving, with both the aim to prevent war and be prepared for it should it come. Complacency kills.\nBy Matthew Thomas\nCover image: FNS Uusimaa, ShipSpotting.com\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/finland_sweden_naval_cooperation/","tags":["Finland","Sweden","Naval"],"title":"Interoperability at Sea"},{"categories":["Cooperation"],"contents":"At the end of last month, Lithuania and Poland announced that the two countries would each assign a brigade to NATO Headquarters in Poland to “train and act together” for the defense of the Suwałki Gap. According to the signed act of affiliation, Lithuania’s Iron Wolf Mechanized Brigade and Poland’s 15th Mechanized Brigade will train jointly to prepare for operations in the Gap, though they will remain under their own national command. The framework for this cooperation has its origins just over a year ago with the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Defense Council, and this is its first concrete act. This agreement will allow for greater cooperation on defense and security related matters, such as coordination of defense plans and joint exercises. Grand comparisons to 15th and 16th Century battles against the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Moscow and even to the Cold War era Fulda Gap aside, this new development in Polish-Lithuanian cooperation is quite welcome in a region widely considered to be a weak spot for NATO.\nThe Suwałki Gap is the narrow Polish-Lithuanian border region sandwiched between Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus. This area is of critical logistical importance to NATO, seeing as it is the only land border between the three Baltic States and the rest of the alliance. Presently, it contains only two minor highways running in a general north-south direction, as well as some smaller local roads and roads used by the logging industry and forest services. As such, it could serve as a tactical chokepoint, wherein Russian forces could stymie troop and supply movements north. Maintaining control over the Suwałki Gap, therefore, is critical in the event of war in the Baltic Theater with Russia.\nThe Suwałki region, however, presents major advantages for defense and significant obstacles for offensive operations. If NATO can deny Russia access, it will be that much more difficult for Russian troops to launch an offensive campaign there. If, on the other hand, NATO does not deny Russia access, and Russia gains control in the region, it will be extraordinarily difficult for NATO to reopen the critical corridor from Suwałki to Kaunas in order to supply operations in the Baltics.\nThe terrain is heavily forested and hilly, and is dotted with lakes, rivers, and marshes. Forests and lakes comprise approximately 50 percent of the land area, while swamps form another 11 percent. The hills run latitudinally and are intersected by rivers and lakes. Moraine dammed lakes are generally shallow, widely dispersed, and have soft embankments, while step, high banks and irregular bottoms characterize local ribbon lakes. Rivers in the region flow northward, and are generally narrow and winding, with steep and heavily forested banks. Many of the coniferous forests in the region are practically impassible, and most are inaccessible (or at least foolhardy) terrain. Clay and sandy clay soils in the region make for impassible conditions in rainy weather with deep, dense, and soggy mud. And indeed, rainy weather is typical for much of the year from the spring thaws all the way to autumn. In the wintertime, snow and frost inhibit movement. Snow covers the ground an average of 90 days per year, heavy frost an average of 50 days, and 30 days see ground frost temperatures. Soils are frozen approximately 120 centimeters deep in the winter, but frozen lakes and rivers may be crossable. Furthermore, the limited road system in the region is poor, and many bridges can only sustain a weight of about 50 tons, which will support a Russian tank, but not an American or British tank, as these average about 70 tons. Though there are pontoon bridges, these are few in number and not suitable for the local rivers. Besides weight limitations, these roads will not sustain movements of larger military vehicles in formation, meaning such equipment would either be forced to find alternate routes or would be “canalized” into long, slow lines or short caravans with limited numbers, nullifying any numerical advantage offensive forces might have.\nMap of the Suwałki region and its physical characteristics.

(103), 2016.\nThe regional terrain and climate are atypical, and local operations will require specialized training and equipment. These conditions readily benefit defensive operations by creating natural defensive lines and allowing armies to restrict movement with limited force, especially if road infrastructure is destroyed. Defenders in the region can further limit maneuverability in a number of ways, including creating engineering obstacles, developing camouflage and deception components to inhibit air and land reconnaissance, and establishing combat support and combat service assets locally. Further, the terrain itself limits the ability to reorganize combat units and restricts logistical support to react to changes in the tactical situation. On the other hand, the terrain supports covert operations. As a result of limited lines of sight and likely robust covert scouting operations, artillery is also limited in its usefulness for offensive operations in the Suwałki region.\nTypical forest wetland landscape near Augustów. Source: augustow.pl\nTwo key considerations must be brought up here: first, NATO can gain a serious tactical advantage by investing in early warning capabilities, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and facilitating information sharing in the region; second, Russia cannot close the Suwałki Gap without involving Belarus somehow. Regarding the first, it is blatantly obvious that NATO can better secure the region by investing in capabilities which enhance situational awareness, but the result of that investment is the key here: greater awareness allows greater time to surge forces into the theater, putting NATO in position to take advantage of a defensive posture in a local environment wholly suited for defense. The second is a little less obvious, as Kaliningrad is itself heavily militarized, while Belarus is less so. But, in order to effectively close the Suwałki Gap, Russia must deploy missiles over or from Belarus, or must deploy troops through Belarus, or less likely, coerce Belarus into joining the fight. Otherwise, a Belarusian route around the Gap remains open in a conventional war scenario. Such moves would escalate the situation to a point where strikes on Kaliningrad, Russian forces in Belarus, or even to the main part of Russia itself would be justified. Belarus, especially as relations currently stand, will be reasonably reluctant to allow any of the above scenarios, and NATO forces could theoretically hold local Russian assets at risk, turning the anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) balance in the region on its head against Moscow.\nThe Suwałki Gap presents both strategic challenges and strategic opportunities. If NATO can secure the Gap, it can maintain the vital overland supply line from Poland to the Baltics. Further, it can use the Gap to hamper Russian activities and capabilities around Kaliningrad and Belarus. From Polish acquisition of F-35 jets and Lithuanian acquisition of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs), to cooperation on the joint Polish-Lithuanian brigade to defend the Suwałki Gap, we have seen many positive measures for improving regional defense. But there is certainly more work to be done. It would be reasonable to expand the number of joint brigades; one probably is not enough. Secondly, infrastructural improvements are needed to ensure NATO tanks can cross bridges safely. NATO should invest in air defense and surveillance systems, and should seek to improve situational awareness locally in the Suwałki region. Finally, NATO needs to train and prepare for operations in the unique conditions the terrain, soil, climate, and infrastructure provide in order to improve overall readiness. As the only land route between the Baltics and the rest of NATO, this small piece of territory bears outsized significance for military operations in the Baltic theater. NATO must maintain it.\nBy Matthew Thomas\nCover photo: Polish-Lithuanian border Photo credit: Stratfor Worldview, worldview.stratfor.com\n Sources:\nCol. Leszek Elak and Col.

A keen observer will notice that Alyaksandar Lukashenka’s Belarus is much the same. All too often, Western analysts have made the mistake of grossly oversimplifying Belarus’ relationship with Russia, as well as its domestic political affairs and broader foreign policy. This has led the West to neglect relations with Minsk, where despite a less than ideal government, great strategic opportunity lies, and where there is also significant strategic risk. The reality is this: Lukashenka is not simply Putin’s puppet in Minsk. He is concerned for his own nation’s sovereignty, and walks a thin tightrope in his relations with both Moscow and the West. Like him or not, there is no viable alternative to Lukashenka, and NATO needs a sovereign and neutral Belarus on the Baltics’ southeastern flank.\nRussia and Belarus have had extensive disagreements on economic matters. While Russia has largely been the economic lifeline for Minsk, and while Minsk has enjoyed huge subsidies on Russian gas, the special relationship between the two has largely gone sour. Arguments over energy prices, much of which center around the purported “oil tax maneuver,” in which Russia will reduce its “dotations” on Belarusian oil by lowering export duties while taxing resource extraction. This is estimated to result in critical losses to the Belarusian energy sector and will likely put significant strain on Belarus’ already weak economy. Likewise, Russia and Belarus have had major disagreements about the latter’s role in the Russian led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). In response, Lukashenka’s government has been seeking economic ties elsewhere, particularly China, the European Union, and Africa. Earlier this year, Lithuania and Poland were making overtures towards Minsk regarding trade in the energy sector, and Belarusian agricultural products reach E.U. markets regularly. However, a central pillar in Minsk’s future trade relations will most certainly be politics. Lukashenka sees too many political demands from both Russia and the E.U., and will increasingly seek to develop ties with the Chinese and with African nations such as Zimbabwe. Case in point, earlier this year Minsk began work on a deal to trade Belarusian heavy machinery for Zimbabwean diamonds and precious metals.\nPresident Lukashenka meets with Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, January 2019. Photo credit: president.gov.by\nBelarus’ relations with the West are just as complicated. Lukashenka has sought to balance cooperation with Western governments on the Northern Distribution Network during the war in Afghanistan and its role as a neutral mediator between Russia and Ukraine in the Minsk Accords against its staunch refusal to acquiesce to Western demands on democratic governance, human rights, and economic liberalization. From the American side, this has led to the imposition of sanctions on Belarus, along with numerous postponements of sanctions, and the two are only now ending an extended period of frosty diplomatic relations wherein Washington and Minsk did not exchange ambassadors.\nIn military affairs, Lukashenka’s tightrope becomes even more bizarre. While Russia and Belarus are friendly partners on paper, and while the two have enjoyed extensive military cooperation, notably in Russia’s Zapad (“West”) military exercises, Russia actively threatens Belarusian security. In response to Lukashenka’s gradual “soft-Belarusianization” and stubbornness on economic matters, Moscow has ramped up its campaign of hybrid warfare on Belarus, particularly with regard to disinformation. Further, many hardliners in the Russian political elite have called for a “Krymnash” (“Crimea is ours”) scenario for Belarus, wherein Belarus would be absorbed into the Russian state in much the same manner as Crimea. Even more, Russia has recently increased its troop presence in both Smolensk and Klintsy near the Belarusian border. Smolensk puts the Russians within a straight shot of Minsk by the E30 highway, along which there are few population centers to offer resistance. At Klintsy, the Russians are near the major Belarusian railway hub at Gomel’. This presence certainly increases the pressure on Minsk\nFor NATO, Belarus is a key strategic point on the Eastern Flank. A sovereign Belarus stands in the way of Russian aggression in the Baltic States. Should the Russians control Belarus, the Suwałki Gap, a narrow strip of land on the border of Lithuania and Poland between Belarus and Kaliningrad, could easily be sealed off, giving the Russians a key logistical advantage while denying land access to the Baltics by NATO reinforcements. Likewise, the current lack of Russian ground troops or air bases in Belarus is a key buffer between Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. By being de facto non-aligned, Belarus provides greater security on the Eastern Flank, allowing for continued NATO access to the Suwałki Gap. The strategic depth Belarus provides is clouded somewhat by its military and economic weakness should Russia decide to violate the former’s sovereignty, and this is precisely why relations with Minsk are taking on greater importance. Much as Western governments do not like the Lukashenka regime, and much as they are right not to, there are no viable alternatives that will maintain stability. The West, therefore, has to accept Lukashenka for who he is and encourage him to keep his country sovereign and neutral.\nCover Photo Credit: kremlin.ru\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/belarus_an_overlooked_key/","tags":["Belarus"],"title":"Belarus: An Overlooked Key to Baltic Security "},{"categories":["Monthly Reports"],"contents":"October 2019 has been busy for the Baltic Security Foundation, pursuing our goal of fostering and promoting Baltic defense and security.

The agenda included current challenges, such as the issue of EU and NATO identities as well as understanding European strategic autonomy. In a regional scope, the conference strongly emphasized the increasing importance of China and the Arctic region, and did not forget to keep Ukraine and Georgia on the agenda, too. Human rights and political power in the digital age formed another fundamental debate among the participants. In addition to the regular program, Mr. Tabuns was invited to moderate the Rīga Conference Future Leaders Forum that gathered 30 graduate students and young professionals from Europe, the U.S., and South Africa. They discussed the preconditions necessary for NATO to remain a relevant and modern alliance. The future leaders identified which NATO priorities are more important to them, personally, and worked on a set of recommendations for what the Alliance could do to obtain the necessary toolkit for it to succeed in the coming years. This is significant in understanding the certain different perspectives across the Transatlantic space, paving the way to common ground among the new generation of opinion and decision makers.\nBetween October 20th and 24th, BSF was honored to host Ms. Maia Otarashvili, a Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Eurasia Program at Foreign Policy Research Institute. She met the BSF team, as well as officials, diplomats, and scholars in Rīga. FPRI runs the Baltic Initiative, designed to advance Americans’ awareness of our region while providing a platform for voices from the region. The Initiative has launched a regular publication titled the Baltic Bulletin, which shares insights about the region with thousands of readers worldwide. The Initiative also organizes public events, and FPRI has supported the organization of AABS conference in Philadelphia. Therefore, Ms. Otarashvili’s visit is expected to strengthen networking between experts on the Baltic region across the Atlantic, especially beyond the Beltway in the U.S.\nOn October 23rd, BSF, in cooperation with BW Consulting, hosted another Baltic Sea Security Initiative Workshop in Berlin, Germany. Experts from Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States assessed the military aspects of Baltic Sea security. They devoted particular attention to the maritime and air domains, strategic and bureaucratic culture, national defense planning, and constitutional considerations. This will be used to formulate practical recommendations to Baltic and Allied decision makers.\nOn October 30th, BSF representatives were invited to participate in the Baltic Security Strategy Forum in Kiel. Hosted by the Institute of Security Policy by Christian Albrecht University in Kiel, the forum dealt with key regional issues in the maritime domain. The high level presenters, including many from the German, Swedish, and U.S. Navies, discussed Swedish-Finnish naval cooperation, gaps in Baltic naval cooperation with the rest of the NATO, and former Soviet naval offensive plans in the Baltic Sea in context of the Russian maritime strategy today.\nBy Otto Tabuns\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/regional_activities/","tags":["Germany","Poland"],"title":"Regional Activities"},{"categories":["Mobility"],"contents":"In October 2019, Baltic Security Foundation hosted Master of International Affairs students from Texas A\u0026amp;M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service for the Young Leaders Mobility Program in Rīga.

This second line would allow for additional gas flows directly from Russia to Western Europe up to a potential 110 billion cubic meters annually. At face value, this expansion is an economic opportunity that makes sense for Germany and other potential Western European customers. In a perfect world, it would be just that. Unfortunately, economic relations with Russia contain security risks. For precisely this reason, Nord Stream 2 faces opposition among Eastern European nations and the Baltic States, as well as from the United States. By cozying up to Russia for cheap gas, Germany is making a Faustian bargain that will not only endanger its allies to the east, but itself as well.\nRussia has long used energy supplies as a foreign policy tool. From the name of the Soviet-era Druzhba (“Friendship”) pipeline on up to Russia’s nearly annual cutting of Ukrainian gas supplies during the winter, it is clear that energy supply has been a key component of Moscow’s soft and hard power tactics alike. Likewise, in cases of “state capture,” the energy sector frequently plays a major role, as in Bulgaria. In Belarus, energy is front and center in disputes between Minsk and Moscow, as the latter seeks to coerce the former into falling in lock-step with the Kremlin’s policies and demands. For the Baltic States, the Soviet-era BRELL Agreement, which connects the electrical grids of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, and Russia synchronously, has given Moscow leverage since it controls the power supply. To their credit, the Baltic States have broken up Gazprom’s vertical monopoly in the regional gas market and have begun preparations to exit the BRELL Agreement, and these positive steps should serve as a model for others to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. But, as Europe’s dependence on foreign energy supplies continues to grow, many other European nations lack the political will to follow the Baltics’ lead, particularly those that do not share the threat perception evident in the east.\nEnergy has likewise served as a point of contention historically between the United States and the European allies. When Egypt, Jordan, and Syria attacked Israel during the 1967 Six Day War, the United States called upon the Europeans to support the Israelis. The Europeans, however, were not so keen to support Israel, even if they were sympathetic to the Israeli cause. For Britain, the decision to maintain a neutral, and even borderline pro-Arab stance, hinged on protecting its image among the Arab states in large part to secure oil supplies and retain Arab investment in British banks. In 2003, opponents of the Iraq War accused the United States of invading Iraq to secure its oil supplies, a refrain picked up by anti- American political leaders in Western Europe. Among these, Gerhard Schröder capitalized on the radical pacifism and anti-Americanism of the German left and excoriated the U.S. for Iraq, which he had previously supported. Now, Schröder, who has long been cozy with Putin, is Chairman of the Board for Nord Stream AG. This inspired the term Schroederizatsiya (“Schröderization”), which refers to the corruption of another country’s political elite. Alongside “state capture,” and often a key component of it, Schröderization is an important part of Russia’s broader hybrid warfare strategy.\nJust as in 2003, Germany and France once again are leading the anti-American bloc among the Europeans. These two are also united with the Kremlin on promoting the Steinmeier Formula for peace in Donetsk and Luhansk. Should the Steinmeier Formula be adopted in Ukraine, France and Germany would be responsible for legitimizing Russia’s actions not only in Ukraine, but in Georgia and Transnistria as well. With so little else in common with Russia, it is not difficult to ascertain that Germany and France have a vested interest in securing Russian energy supplies and are thus willing to side with the Kremlin against Ukraine, NATO allies along the Eastern Flank, and the United States.\nPhoto Credit: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\nWhat, then, does this all mean? Nord Stream 2, along with the southern Turk Stream route, will enable Russia to bypass old routes through Ukraine and Eastern Europe, ensuring a continuous stream of supply to Western European customers while at the same time denying that security to Eastern European nations that oppose Moscow. If Nord Stream 2 is completed, it will increase Western Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, giving Russia greater political and diplomatic leverage in its relations with those countries. While there has been much panic about divisions within NATO, the alliance has always experienced some disunity. But as many rush to defend the more complacent allies, such as Germany, they fail to realize the potential damage its recalcitrance may bring to the alliance. Though U.S. President Trump’s bluster may aggravate the Europeans, his administration has shown that in deed, the United States is hardly bent on retrenchment, and is in reality more committed to Europe than perhaps any other time since the Cold War. By cozying up to Russia on Nord Stream, however, Germany risks betraying its allies and increasing Russian influence at home. This dangerous policy alignment sets Germany down the path towards state capture and could do serious, lasting damage to NATO’s effectiveness as a defensive alliance.\nUnfortunately, what good news there was on stopping Nord Stream 2 took a decidedly negative turn this week. Along with U.S. sanctions on companies affiliated with Nord Stream, Denmark was holding up progress laying the pipeline through its territorial waters via its permitting process. The Danes have been key friends to the Baltic States since Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia regained independence in 1991. Unfortunately, Denmark approved the permits for Nord Stream 2 on Wednesday, October 30th. Should U.S. and other E.U. members’ efforts succeed in derailing Nord Stream 2, NATO can potentially avoid the situation outlined above. With Denmark’s efforts over, however, it is looking more and more bleak. Western Europe should seek instead to diversify its energy resources and where these resources come from. The Baltic model for greater self-sufficiency, coupled with American and South Korean partnerships on liquefied natural gas (LNG), serves as a potential pathway towards reducing dependence on Russian energy. Likewise, Poland has announced that it is cutting off Russian gas imports and instead turning towards the Norwegians, American LNG, and its own wells off the Norwegian coast. On energy, the Baltics and Poland serve as positive models to the rest of Europe: by reducing their dependence on Russian energy supplies, they remove political and diplomatic leverage from Moscow and reduce Russian influence on their governments. By choosing to pursue Nord Stream 2, however, Germany risks going the way of Bulgaria, where the energy sector is dominated by Gazprom and the political system now much more resembles that of Russia than when it first joined the European Union. Should Nord Stream 2 prevail, Germany will betray its allies and weaken the defensive alliance, dividing Europe between East and West once more.\nA single section of the pipeline remains incomplete around the Danish island of Bornholm, but Denmark approved the permits to build the pipeline on Wednesday, October 30. Photo credit: neftegaz.ru\u0026lt;\nFor the Baltic States, Nord Stream 2 is not an immediate threat to their energy supplies. They have greatly reduced their dependence on Russia in the energy sector. Their primary concern regarding Russia’s ability to cut off their energy supplies is not the route those supplies take, but the insecurity of their infrastructure, as many cables are unburied and unhidden, and many onshore components are poorly guarded, if at all. Nord Stream 2 is, however, a grave threat to the Baltic States’ broader security. Should Germany be a whole nation “Schröderized,” NATO will have a difficult time coping politically. Worse than that, though, NATO logistics will risk being completely thrown off track. While this scenario seems unlikely to come into fruition completely in the near-term, some aspects of the scenario will. The radical pacifism of Germany’s left and center, as well as growing anti-Americanism, open the door for Russian influence in government. Increased dependence on Russian energy will open that door wider, making Germany an even weaker link in NATO than it already is. Many Western European nations that do not have such heightened threat perception with regard to Russia, and that have a greater affinity towards the German-led European Union over NATO, will be tempted to follow Germany’s lead. For Russia, a weakened NATO is an opportunity. For the Baltics, a weakened NATO is an existential threat.\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/stopping_nord_stream/","tags":["Nord Stream 2"],"title":"Why Stopping Nord Stream 2 Matters for the Baltics"},{"categories":["Maritime Policy"],"contents":"Maritime operations have once again been a major theme of recent headlines in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Following the NATO BALTOPS exercises this summer, repeated violations of the Baltic States’ airspace by Russia, and observing current combat diving operations in Tallinn Bay, maritime security issues are particularly relevant. Unfortunately, given the long-standing emphasis on land-based deterrence, the maritime domain has largely been neglected.\nBALTOPS 2019 revealed a key weakness for naval operations: the shallow and largely unmarked coastline hampered amphibious landing operations in Lithuania. Not only do these conditions make amphibious landing operations slower and more difficult, they even present major operational hazards. One Polish landing vessel reportedly ran aground during the exercises. While there is not much that can be done about shallow water, Lithuanian and U.S. forces have responded to these weaknesses by conducting coastal observation studies and exploring the seabed along the Lithuanian coast. Given that the Baltic States’ only land border with the rest of the alliance is the narrow Suwałki Gap on the Polish- Lithuanian border, NATO cannot rely on land connections for logistical support. As such, the ability to conduct amphibious landings with troops and supplies is vital.\nIt would be wonderful if a poorly marked coastline and shallow water were the only deficiencies in the Baltic States’ maritime defense. Unfortunately, the Baltic States lack the ability to prevent Russia from projecting power into their territorial waters, port facilities, exclusive economic zones, and other littoral areas. Furthermore, the Baltic States cannot prevent Russia from temporarily taking control of these areas. The Russian Baltic Sea fleet may not be overly large or impressive, but it is more than capable of maintaining the status quo, harassing military and civilian activity at sea, and taking surprise offensive action. After all, Russian naval harassment is not unknown – Lithuanian sailors laying the NordBalt cable were repeatedly antagonized by Russian ships – and grey zone operations are a key component of Russian strategy.\nThis situation only gets worse. The Baltic States are currently deficient in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities at sea. They do not have full, integrated, and shared awareness across the surface, subsurface, and air domains. Individual states’ capabilities vary, but Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are all deficient at ISR in the maritime domain given the context of their current security environment. Likewise, the Baltic States have had varying levels of success with sharing information. As it stands, there is no full-time command center to process threats at sea and determine how to respond. The multiple recent violations of Baltic airspace by Russian military aircraft underscores the importance of ISR capabilities and information sharing between the Baltic States. In order to process and respond to threats, one first must know that they are there.\nYet more bad news: the maritime domain hosts several key components of the Baltic States’ critical energy and communications infrastructure. Undersea cables, gas interconnectors, and onshore facilities such as the Klaipėda LNG terminal are all vulnerable to attack. Many cables are unburied and unhidden, such as the NordBalt cable, which connects the Baltic and Nordic electricity markets. Likewise, many other infrastructural components are poorly guarded, if at all. These components create key weaknesses for Russia to exploit in the event of an attack. Cutting off gas or electricity supply will likely wear down societal resilience to propaganda, and will complicate military logistics and decision making as well.\nWith such a heavy focus over the last several years on land-based deterrence, the Baltic States have largely neglected the maritime domain. CPT Bill Combes (U.S. Navy, retired) refers to this condition as “sea-apathy,” and it has led to gaps in procurement, awareness, capabilities, and strategy. Many experts, such as Combes, have provided excellent suggestions to improve the situation. The author makes no attempt to claim the following recommendations as his own, but has selected those from other experts that he has deemed most practical and actionable:\nFirst: the Baltic States need to develop clear goals and a comprehensive maritime strategy. This strategy should identify important investments required for robust maritime domain awareness.\nSecond: in order to reduce costs and improve interoperability, the Baltic States should identify opportunities for joint procurements in maritime ISR technology.\nThird: the Baltic States need to implement a combined and cooperative Naval Operations Center in order to best focus individual maritime capabilities to mutual benefit and facilitate higher-end NATO operations. Further, the Baltic States should establish a joint Maritime Command Center which could identify and process threats and determine how best to respond.\nFinally: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia all need to focus on becoming effective “coastal powers,” as Combes calls it. Their navies do not need to be large and grandiose, but they do need to be able to protect infrastructural assets, trade, and communication in the maritime domain.\nThe current situation in the maritime domain is most certainly not ideal. However, it can be improved by taking practical steps like those outlined above and participating in ongoing NATO training exercises. The coast is a key component of the Baltic States’ security both in peace-time and in the event of war. As such, “sea-apathy” cannot remain a feature of the Baltic States’ defense posture.\nBy Matthew Thomas\nCover Photo: BALTOPS 2019 / Benas Gerdžiūnas / LRT\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/improving_maritime_security/","tags":["Naval","Maritime"],"title":"Improving the Baltic States’ Maritime Security"},{"categories":["Conference"],"contents":"BSF President Mr. Olevs Nikers and BSF Director Mr. Otto Tabuns took part in the panel “Addressing Security Challenges in the Baltic Region through Multilateral Cooperation” of the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) 13th General Conference September 5, 2019 in Wrocław, Poland.\nDuring his presentation “Sub-Regional Defense Synchronization – Theory Perspectives and Security Expectations for the Baltics,” Mr. Nikers outlined and discussed the origin and sustainability of the modern security alliance between small countries. He focused on the Baltic States, and took the issue of alliance formation beyond the realm of Cold War-era power balancing, upon which the main alliance- building theory was formed.\nFrom one side, the presentation discussed current issues regarding the Baltic States’ security cooperation, which were identified and analyzed within the Baltic Security Strategy Project (2018-2019) by scholars and government professionals from the Baltic States. From the other side, the panel examined traditional and modern theoretical perspectives, answering the question of whether small states are capable of boosting their defenses and enhancing deterrence by synchronizing their security and improving military interoperability within the collective security system.\nThe 13th ECPR General Conference took place in Wrocław September 4-7, 2019.

Since regaining independence after the illegal Soviet occupation, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all become deeply integrated into Western institutions, such as NATO and the EU. These small countries, understanding the potential peril of reoccupation by a resurgent Russia after the annexation of Crimea, have been extremely vocal in sounding the alarm that Russia remains a security threat. They understand that the West must get serious about security lest its more vulnerable members once more get trampled.\nThirty years ago this month, the Baltic States sent Gorbachev a clear message by forming a massive, 2 million member human chain from Tallinn, Estonia all the way to Vilnius, Lithuania. This show of resolve, known as the Baltic Way, demonstrated that the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian patriots would not be suppressed in their push for independence from Communist tyranny. This large- scale, peaceful popular protest was a remarkable event within the broader miracle of 1989 in Eastern Europe, and has today inspired the people of Hong Kong to make their own “Hong Kong Way.” But, as we in the West celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way, let us not forget the 80th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the danger posed by ambitious neighbors.\nThe Baltic States’ geographic situation is an unfortunate one. They are largely cut off by land from their NATO allies, their terrain has few natural barriers to an invading force, and the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet operates to the Baltic States’ north and south in St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad. The Suwałki Gap, a narrow strip of land on the border of Lithuania and Poland, constitutes the only land border between the Baltic States and the rest of NATO. This tiny strip with two highways lies between Belarus and Kaliningrad, meaning that Russia could easily seal it off, making a logistical nightmare for NATO to come to the Baltics’ aid. At sea, the Russian Navy is not particularly impressive, but is more than capable of harassing ships and conducting grey zone operations on infrastructure and the port and supply chains.\nThis unfortunate geographic situation, combined with Russian military buildup in the Western Military District and Russia’s propensity to meddle in its neighbors’ affairs, makes Baltic Security of vital importance to NATO. As things currently stand, Russia prefers to stay below the threshold of conventional war, knowing that its conventional forces may have a short-term advantage, but that in the long-run, NATO forces are superior. As such, Russia seeks to destabilize the political situation through hybrid means, such as misinformation/disinformation, economic capture, the use of proxy groups as an element of “aktivnye meropriyatiya” (“active measures”) in intelligence operations, and cyber-attacks. By utilizing hybrid warfare against the spectrum of a state’s governmental and societal functions, Russia economizes the use of force and is able to continuously adjust the intensity of conflict. It is important to remember that Russia views itself in conflict with NATO, even though the two are not locked in conventional war.\nAs the situation stands now, Russia is probably unlikely to conduct conventional military operations against the Baltic States. Its economy cannot sustain this kind of war, and it is currently mired in other theaters. Nevertheless, Russia will absolutely continue its hybrid efforts against Baltic society and government, as it seeks to undermine Western influence and restore the Baltic States to its sphere of influence. Indeed, Russia successfully annexed Crimea without firing a shot using a comprehensive package of hybrid tactics, perhaps most famously the “little green men” at a time when it viewed Western leadership as weak and feckless. NATO leadership must remain strong and resolute against the Russian threat, and Western European leaders need to understand that they have a moral imperative to defend their own people as part and parcel of their obligation to NATO. A Russian attack on the Baltic States will inevitably test Article 5 (the principle of “an attack on one is an attack on all”), upon which NATO’s credibility hangs. Likewise, the Baltic States must continue to make strides on societal security, infrastructural security (including energy security), financial security, cyber-security, and defense/deterrence. The work being done in the region is good, and needs to continue in order to maintain freedom in the Baltics.\nFrom the “Year of Terror” in 1941 to re-independence in 1991, the Baltic States suffered under tyranny. For Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, national security is a matter of state survival. Freedom is vulnerable, and must be guarded with vigilance and enthusiasm. Russia must be taken seriously: all too often, the political discourse in the U.S. and Europe recognizes the threat that Russia poses, but fails to understand the nature of Russian tactics. Likewise, many political groups seek to associate their opponents with Russia, while ignoring Russian influence on their own parties, undermining faith in democratic institutions and doing the Russians’ work for them. For NATO, Baltic security is a matter of credibility. If the Baltic States fall and NATO does not respond, the alliance will no longer be taken seriously, and its defense will be undermined. For the United States, it is a matter of both credibility and affinity – the U.S. seeks to defend liberty in the face of tyranny wherever it exists. An aggressive Russia not only threatens security in Europe, but also threatens security in the U.S. After all, Russia seeks to undermine American political stability as well. In geopolitics, everything is interconnected, and the U.S. and Europe cannot afford to neglect any region, especially not the Baltics.\nPhoto Credit: US Embassy, Latvia\nCover Photo: NATO (nato.int)\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/is_baltic_security_important/","tags":["NATO","Europe","Important","US"],"title":"Is Baltic Security Important for the U.S., NATO, and Europe?
