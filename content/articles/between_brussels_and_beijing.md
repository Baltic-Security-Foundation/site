Between Brussels and Beijing: The Transatlantic Response to the Chinese Presence in the Baltic Sea Region serves as a comprehensive analysis of China’s presence in the Baltic Sea littoral countries and subsequently related developments in the domains of education, finance and infrastructure.

Scholars Olevs Nikers and Otto Tabuns together with their Baltic Security Foundation team and other regional and international experts provide a set of in-depth national case studies. This publication is the result of the project “China and the Baltic: Mapping a Transatlantic Response to Chinese Inroads in the Nordic-Baltic Region” organized by the Baltic Security Foundation, The Jamestown Foundation and the Baltic-American Freedom Foundation. The participating experts and professionals from the Baltic Sea partnering countries identify and analyze the presence and impact of the People’s Republic of China on European security within the strategic Nordic-Baltic region and the implications of this growing regional Chinese presence on wider transatlantic relations. The geographic focus of this study includes Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark (with particular attention given to Greenland).

Despite the numerous publications and events dealing with this subject, much critical thinking and painful discussion still lies ahead. This book aims to indicate the directions for further consideration and public conversations that will contribute to improved regional and transatlantic security. This publication is intended to aid in that endeavor and serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, professionals and scholars seeking to address the challenges facing the West in the Baltic Sea region.
