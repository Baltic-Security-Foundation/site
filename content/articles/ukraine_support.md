The Baltic Security Foundation continues to support Ukrainian refugees in Latvia and the civilians in Ukraine. First of all, our team member Andreis Purim has been personally involved to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Lviv, Ukraine. 

Furthermore, since summer of 2022, the Baltic Security Foundation has gathered support from the U.S. Embassy in Latvia and many non-governmental organizations and individual supporters to provide free English classes for the Ukrainian refugees who have fled the Russian aggression. In half a year, over 350 Ukrainian refugees (i.e. more than 1% of all Ukrainian refugees in Latvia) have benefitted as a result of their participation. This has helped to improve the societal integration and employability of the refugees, as well as expanding their access to a variety of international information sources.

For ways on how to support the Ukrainian civilians via the BSF, please contact us at <info@balticsecurity.eu>.
