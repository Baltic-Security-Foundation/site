On October 6, 2022, the State Secretary of Latvian Ministry of Defense Jānis Garisons visited the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M and met with Professor Gabriela Marin Thornton and her students who research Baltic security in their capstone course. The capstone course participants partner with the Baltic Security Foundation to propose ways to increase Baltic resilience with a focus on Latvia. The meeting presented an opportunity to discuss the preliminary findings and compare the perspectives on the most important regional security issues in the Baltic Sea Region. Pictured here are the participants of the meeting Chris Cutrone, Emily Ashbridge, Maddison Gold, Amb. Larry Napper, Department Head Dr. David Bearce, State Secretary Jānis Garisons, Paul Kroeger, Prof. Thornton and Bekkah Chatham.
