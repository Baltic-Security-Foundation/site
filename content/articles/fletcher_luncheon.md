On November 17 Olevs Nikers, President of the Baltic Security Foundation visited affiliates of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. A special luncheon gathered students and professors of this program to discuss the global security situation, Russia's war against Ukraine and its implications for Baltic Security, as well as Chinese presence in the Baltic Sea Region. Special interest from the side of the students was expressed in the Transatlantic Security Exchange, using the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the details of this exchange, organized by the Baltic Security Foundation.
The Luncheon was generously hosted by Arik Burakovsky, Assistant Director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
