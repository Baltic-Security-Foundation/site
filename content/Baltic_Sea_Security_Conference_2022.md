**Transatlantic response to China’s presence in the Baltic Sea Region**

The Euroatlantic states sharing the Baltic Sea have been subject to persistent security threats that have made them seek international solutions to maintain peace and stability. Challenges associated with Russia have been at the forefront for decades and are so today with its war against Ukraine. Meanwhile over the last decade the regional presence of China has increased - welcomed by many but analyzed by few. The security implications are beyond national and require a focus across NATO to find the best response.

The Baltic Sea Security Conference will gather experts in Berlin to review China’s presence in the Baltic Sea region. Organized by the Baltic Security Foundation, the Jamestown Foundation and the Baltic-American Freedom Foundation, the conference showcases the project “China and the Baltic: Mapping a Transatlantic Response to Chinese Inroads in the Nordic-Baltic Region”. The speakers will discuss national case studies on the said presence in the areas of infrastructure, education and finance. The primary geographic focus of this study includes Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway, as well as Denmark and Greenland.

The participants of the conference will be able to discuss the current state, perception and reaction connected with China’s presence at the Baltic Sea region. They will also be able to discuss the national, European and NATO security implications of the said presence.
