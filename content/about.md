<hr />

Estabilished in 2019, <b>The Baltic Security Foundation (BSF)</b> promotes the security and defense of the Baltic Sea region.

The Foundation is a result of the <b>Baltic Security Strategy Project (2017-2019)</b> that gathered experts on defence, societal security and economic security to assess the shared challenges for the Baltic States and recommend solutions.

BSF gathers Baltic experts and security experts from the region and beyond. It provides a platform for discussion and research, expert networking, expert mobility, and promotes finding and advocating for solutions that lead to a stronger regional security in military and other areas.
