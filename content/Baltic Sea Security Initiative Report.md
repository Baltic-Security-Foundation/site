description: "The complex Baltic Sea Region lies at the top of the agenda for many policymakers, strategists, and security stakeholders in Europe and beyond. The area, centered around one of the busiest seas in the world, is home to a hundred million people, covers nine countries, and is divided among several geopolitical blocs. And though the Baltic basin has not seen interstate war in three quarters of a century, the region nonetheless continues to experience periodic ratcheting up of tensions between Russia and members of the Euro-Atlantic community."
