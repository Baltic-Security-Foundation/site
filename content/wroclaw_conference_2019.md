BSF President Mr. Olevs Nikers and BSF Director Mr. Otto Tabuns took part in the panel “Addressing
Security Challenges in the Baltic Region through Multilateral Cooperation” of the European Consortium
for Political Research (ECPR) 13th General Conference September 5, 2019 in Wrocław, Poland.
</p>
<p align="justify">
During his presentation “Sub-Regional Defense Synchronization – Theory Perspectives and Security
Expectations for the Baltics,” Mr. Nikers outlined and discussed the origin and sustainability of the
modern security alliance between small countries. He focused on the Baltic States, and took the issue of
alliance formation beyond the realm of Cold War-era power balancing, upon which the main alliance-
building theory was formed.

<p align="justify">
From one side, the presentation discussed current issues regarding the Baltic States’ security cooperation,
which were identified and analyzed within the Baltic Security Strategy Project (2018-2019) by scholars
and government professionals from the Baltic States. From the other side, the panel examined traditional
and modern theoretical perspectives, answering the question of whether small states are capable of
boosting their defenses and enhancing deterrence by synchronizing their security and improving military
interoperability within the collective security system.
