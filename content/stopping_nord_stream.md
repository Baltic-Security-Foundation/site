Nord Stream 2 is a Russian gas pipeline project running mostly parallel to the current Nord Stream
pipeline from Vyborg to Greifswald, Germany. This second line would allow for additional gas flows
directly from Russia to Western Europe up to a potential 110 billion cubic meters annually. At face value,
this expansion is an economic opportunity that makes sense for Germany and other potential Western
European customers. In a perfect world, it would be just that. Unfortunately, economic relations with
Russia contain security risks. For precisely this reason, Nord Stream 2 faces opposition among Eastern
European nations and the Baltic States, as well as from the United States. By cozying up to Russia for
cheap gas, Germany is making a Faustian bargain that will not only endanger its allies to the east, but
itself as well.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Russia has long used energy supplies as a foreign policy tool. From the name of the Soviet-era Druzhba
(“Friendship”) pipeline on up to Russia’s nearly annual cutting of Ukrainian gas supplies during the
winter, it is clear that energy supply has been a key component of Moscow’s soft and hard power tactics
alike. Likewise, in cases of “state capture,” the energy sector frequently plays a major role, as in Bulgaria.
In Belarus, energy is front and center in disputes between Minsk and Moscow, as the latter seeks to
coerce the former into falling in lock-step with the Kremlin’s policies and demands. For the Baltic States,
the Soviet-era BRELL Agreement, which connects the electrical grids of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,
Belarus, and Russia synchronously, has given Moscow leverage since it controls the power supply. To
their credit, the Baltic States have broken up Gazprom’s vertical monopoly in the regional gas market and
have begun preparations to exit the BRELL Agreement, and these positive steps should serve as a model
for others to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. But, as Europe’s dependence on foreign energy
supplies continues to grow, many other European nations lack the political will to follow the Baltics’
lead, particularly those that do not share the threat perception evident in the east.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Energy has likewise served as a point of contention historically between the United States and the
European allies. When Egypt, Jordan, and Syria attacked Israel during the 1967 Six Day War, the United
States called upon the Europeans to support the Israelis. The Europeans, however, were not so keen to
support Israel, even if they were sympathetic to the Israeli cause. For Britain, the decision to maintain a
neutral, and even borderline pro-Arab stance, hinged on protecting its image among the Arab states in
large part to secure oil supplies and retain Arab investment in British banks. In 2003, opponents of the
Iraq War accused the United States of invading Iraq to secure its oil supplies, a refrain picked up by anti-
American political leaders in Western Europe. Among these, Gerhard Schröder capitalized on the radical
pacifism and anti-Americanism of the German left and excoriated the U.S. for Iraq, which he had
previously supported. Now, Schröder, who has long been cozy with Putin, is Chairman of the Board for
Nord Stream AG. This inspired the term Schroederizatsiya (“Schröderization”), which refers to the
corruption of another country’s political elite. Alongside “state capture,” and often a key component of it,
Schröderization is an important part of Russia’s broader hybrid warfare strategy.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Just as in 2003, Germany and France once again are leading the anti-American bloc among the
Europeans. These two are also united with the Kremlin on promoting the Steinmeier Formula for peace in
Donetsk and Luhansk. Should the Steinmeier Formula be adopted in Ukraine, France and Germany would
be responsible for legitimizing Russia’s actions not only in Ukraine, but in Georgia and Transnistria as
well. With so little else in common with Russia, it is not difficult to ascertain that Germany and France
have a vested interest in securing Russian energy supplies and are thus willing to side with the Kremlin
against Ukraine, NATO allies along the Eastern Flank, and the United States.

What, then, does this all mean? Nord Stream 2, along with the southern Turk Stream route, will enable
Russia to bypass old routes through Ukraine and Eastern Europe, ensuring a continuous stream of supply
to Western European customers while at the same time denying that security to Eastern European nations
that oppose Moscow. If Nord Stream 2 is completed, it will increase Western Europe’s dependence on
Russian energy, giving Russia greater political and diplomatic leverage in its relations with those
countries. While there has been much panic about divisions within NATO, the alliance has always
experienced some disunity. But as many rush to defend the more complacent allies, such as Germany,
they fail to realize the potential damage its recalcitrance may bring to the alliance. Though U.S. President
Trump’s bluster may aggravate the Europeans, his administration has shown that in deed, the United
States is hardly bent on retrenchment, and is in reality more committed to Europe than perhaps any other
time since the Cold War. By cozying up to Russia on Nord Stream, however, Germany risks betraying its
allies and increasing Russian influence at home. This dangerous policy alignment sets Germany down the
path towards state capture and could do serious, lasting damage to NATO’s effectiveness as a defensive
alliance.

Unfortunately, what good news there was on stopping Nord Stream 2 took a decidedly negative turn this
week. Along with U.S. sanctions on companies affiliated with Nord Stream, Denmark was holding up
progress laying the pipeline through its territorial waters via its permitting process. The Danes have been
key friends to the Baltic States since Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia regained independence in 1991.
Unfortunately, Denmark approved the permits for Nord Stream 2 on Wednesday, October 30th. Should
U.S. and other E.U. members’ efforts succeed in derailing Nord Stream 2, NATO can potentially avoid
the situation outlined above. With Denmark’s efforts over, however, it is looking more and more bleak.
Western Europe should seek instead to diversify its energy resources and where these resources come
from. The Baltic model for greater self-sufficiency, coupled with American and South Korean
partnerships on liquefied natural gas (LNG), serves as a potential pathway towards reducing dependence
on Russian energy. Likewise, Poland has announced that it is cutting off Russian gas imports and instead
turning towards the Norwegians, American LNG, and its own wells off the Norwegian coast. On energy,
the Baltics and Poland serve as positive models to the rest of Europe: by reducing their dependence on
Russian energy supplies, they remove political and diplomatic leverage from Moscow and reduce Russian
influence on their governments. By choosing to pursue Nord Stream 2, however, Germany risks going the
way of Bulgaria, where the energy sector is dominated by Gazprom and the political system now much
more resembles that of Russia than when it first joined the European Union. Should Nord Stream 2
prevail, Germany will betray its allies and weaken the defensive alliance, dividing Europe between East
and West once more.

For the Baltic States, Nord Stream 2 is not an immediate threat to their energy supplies. They have greatly
reduced their dependence on Russia in the energy sector. Their primary concern regarding Russia’s ability
to cut off their energy supplies is not the route those supplies take, but the insecurity of their
infrastructure, as many cables are unburied and unhidden, and many onshore components are poorly
guarded, if at all. Nord Stream 2 is, however, a grave threat to the Baltic States’ broader security. Should
Germany be a whole nation “Schröderized,” NATO will have a difficult time coping politically. Worse
than that, though, NATO logistics will risk being completely thrown off track. While this scenario seems
unlikely to come into fruition completely in the near-term, some aspects of the scenario will. The radical
pacifism of Germany’s left and center, as well as growing anti-Americanism, open the door for Russian
influence in government. Increased dependence on Russian energy will open that door wider, making
Germany an even weaker link in NATO than it already is. Many Western European nations that do not
have such heightened threat perception with regard to Russia, and that have a greater affinity towards the
German-led European Union over NATO, will be tempted to follow Germany’s lead. For Russia, a
weakened NATO is an opportunity. For the Baltics, a weakened NATO is an existential threat.
