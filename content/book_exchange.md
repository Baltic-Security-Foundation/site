The Baltic Security Foundation team shares their most recent books to universities around the world to promote the studies of regional security. The BSF president Mr. Olevs Nikers visited the University of Washington and donated copies of "Baltic Sea Security: Regional and Sectoral Perspectives" to the UW University Libraries. The BSF team looks forward to these books being useful for the university, especially for its renown Baltic Studies program.
