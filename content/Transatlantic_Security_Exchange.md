The Baltic Security Foundation has launched the Transatlantic Security Exchange. The program brings together experts and researchers from Europe and America to focus on further studies of Baltic security in regional and international context.

This week, the BSF team welcomed Rebekkah Chatham and Travis Andrews from the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government & Public Service who will visit several Baltic Sea states for their research on NATO, influence of Russia and China in Europe, regional military cooperation and food security.
