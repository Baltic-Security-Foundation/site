The Baltic Security Foundation (BSF), established in 2019, promotes the security and defense of the Baltic Sea region.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The Foundation is a result of the Baltic Security Strategy Project (2017-2019) that gathered experts on defence, societal security and economic security to assess the shared challenges for the Baltic States and recommend solutions.
</p>
<p align="justify">
BSF gathers Baltic experts and security experts from the region and beyond. It provides a platform for discussion and research, expert networking, expert mobility, and promotes finding and advocating for solutions that lead to a stronger regional security in military and other areas.

#### History 

<p align="justify">
In 11 July 2019, the Baltic Security Foundation (BSF) was officially established by Mr. Olevs Nikers, President of the BSF and Mr. Otto Tabuns, Director. The goal of the BSF is to promote and foster Baltic regional defense and security. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Thirty years ago, on August 23, 1989, two million Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians joined hands in the Baltic Way human chain. Their common deliberation paved the way to regaining Baltic independence. Today, the three Baltic States stand strong. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
However, many find that so much more could be done by speaking in one, stronger voice. This is especially the case in regard to security and the three Baltic expert communities. This is one of the key conclusions of the Baltic Security Strategy Project, which was led by Mr. Olevs Nikers and Mr. Otto Tabuns (February 2018 – March 2019) – the largest independent Baltic security cooperation projects involving regional stakeholders from across the board. Common security is predicated on common expertise that requires strategic thinking and a systematic approach. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Current analytic structures in each Baltic state are limited by human resources and funding to implement systematic medium and long-term regional strategic analysis, representing the region in one voice. Intraregional cooperation of scholars and professionals on the matters of their region is incidental. E.g. the Baltic Security Strategy Project was unique in its nature, gathering security experts – scholars and professionals from the Baltic countries within a single cooperation endeavor. There is also lack of a single pool of expertise, gathering the contact information and the material of work of the most notable regional field experts. An umbrella organization is needed to do just that, therefore strengthening the think tanks and other research organizations across the Baltic countries. 
</p>

The objectives of BSF are to: 

- **1.** Raise awareness of Baltic defense and security matters among allied and regional partners, 
- **2.** Organize and facilitate Baltic security expert cooperation through designated instruments of financial and administrative support, 
- **3.** Provide and facilitate Baltic security policy analysis and advice for Baltic and Allied stakeholders, 
- **4.** Foster Baltic security and defense synchronization through discussion and legislation,
- **5.** strengthen local Baltic expertise and raise national think tank capacity. 

<p align="justify">
The BSF works as a cluster of Baltic defense and security experts, professionals and think tanks, organizing activities that involve at least three Baltic states, and as an instrument for attraction of financial resources to maintain and facilitate activities which support Objectives of the BSF. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
The primary focus of the BSF activity is the Baltic Sea region within the Euro Atlantic framework. It is a non-profit organization which operates on the concluding cooperation agreements with Baltic think tanks and individual experts. Partnership is open for all governmental and private institutions, as well as individual experts that support the goal and objectives of the BSF. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Anyone who shares the goals and objectives of the BSF — individual experts and organizations within the region and beyond — is welcome to partner with BSF! 
</p>
<p align="justify">
BSF membership will grant access to our network of Baltic defense and Security experts and Organizations and priority to be engaged in our activities and Projects as agreed and (2) Individual Members and Organizations are eligible to apply for any support from BSF available - to implement activities/Projects etc., which supports Goal and Objective of the BSF or (3) provide moral support to BSF mission, which is also necessary for demonstration of our unity and coherence and will help to succeed Goal and Objectives of the BSF.
