[{"categories":["Geopolitics"],"contents":"At the beginning of this month, the U.S. delivered 128 javelin anti-tank missiles to Estonia, part of ongoing cooperation between the two countries. This will provide another moderate boost to the credibility of Estonia’s deterrent posture. These kinds of smaller procurements are an important part of the broader effort to build up a credible defense in case of Russian aggression and to signal that the risk outweighs the reward for attacking the Baltic States.\nYet, the numbers on this procurement highlight that while the region is perhaps best viewed as a single battle space, and while the three countries are stronger when they work together, each has different concerns based on individual characteristics. For Estonia, large scale tank warfare is not as reasonable a concern as it is for Lithuania. Here, geography plays a key role in determining how highly each state should prioritize anti-tank capabilities.\nFor Estonia, the primary concern for tank warfare will be along highways and in urban centers. Most likely this will be centered along the Narva-Rakvere-Tallinn route. But, in this environment, tanks will likely have less of an impact, as they are not well suited to fighting in built-up areas with limited space. Likewise, tanks are more vulnerable to anti-tank defenses in such environments. For Estonia, the forests, wetlands, and various hilly areas leave little open room for tanks to maneuver, pushing them to other areas where they will likely only play a supporting role.\nSource: CIA World Factbook 2011, created by Wikipedia user Radom1967 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0\nThough flatter, Latvia is just heavily forested as Estonia. For it, the primary concerns will be along highways, urban areas, and in the open fields of Zemgale. Parts of Latgale to the southeast may also be suitable for tank action. In Vidzeme, dense forests make the region unsuitable for tank warfare, and along the coast in the north, wetlands present an obstacle to tanks, pushing them to the road. This continues in Estonia, leaving tanks limited in their usefulness to the north. In February of 2018, Latvia signed a €108 million deal with EuroSpike for Spike anti-tank missiles. These missiles will also be installed on Latvia’s CVR(T) vehicles. For Latvia, the primary concern is to the south and southeast and along the Via Baltica highway to Rīga. But, unless an attack were launched in Latgale from within Belarus or Russia, Latvia’s chances of seeing tank warfare are largely dependent on Russian tanks’ success or failure in Lithuania.\nFor Lithuania, tank warfare is a very real and likely threat. Of the three Baltic countries, it has the longest ongoing cooperation with the United States on anti-tank missile procurements going back to 2002, and in February of last year, Lithuania purchased an additional $20 million in Javelin missiles. The country has far less forest cover compared with the other two, and is largely flat in the central lowlands. Open fields provide the kind of maneuverability that tanks need to be effective. But, to the southeast, which would be the most likely approach for Russian tanks, the hills around Vilnius favor defense. Thus, NATO needs to be prepared in order to prevent the Russians from getting past these hills to the lowlands around Kaunas. At Kaunas, logistics overland via the Suwałki Gap could be cut off and the Russians could connect their supply lines to Kaliningrad.\nRussia maintains numerical superiority in tanks compared to NATO. Furthermore, Russian tanks are lighter weight than British or American tanks. For the Russians, tank divisions are a key strength, and as such will be used in the Baltic theater in the event of war, even though the theater as a whole is not well suited for them. Thus, they will likely seek to leverage that strength where it is most useful in Lithuania. For NATO and each of the three Baltic states themselves, anti-tank missiles, be they Javelins, Spikes, or Carl Gustavs, are a critical leveling force against Russia. Indeed, anti-tank capabilities will be critical for maintaining an open supply line along the Via Baltica until NATO can get its own tanks into the theater. Even then, anti-tank missiles will be a crucial component of NATO’s countermeasures against Russian forces.\nWith all this in mind, the Baltics should strategize which procurements should be made jointly, and which should be based on individual circumstances. The military and political leadership need to be thinking critically about individual strengths and weaknesses, both in capabilities and in geography. Procurements should be tailored to strategy, and should not be done without considering the forces, factors, and drivers within individual countries alongside the region as a whole. Here, intelligence and information sharing are also critical to developing a coherent strategy and defensive posture. In order to deter Russian attack, defensive abilities must be credible. In order for the Baltics to have more than just a “porcupine” defense, there needs to be more strategic and practical thinking from the top down. With this kind of coordinated effort, NATO could come in as defenders, rather than liberators. Without it, war will be much longer, and much more painful.\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/tank_warfare_baltics/","tags":["US","Estonia"],"title":"Javelin Deliveries and the Prospects of Tank Warfare in the Baltics"},{"categories":["Cooperation"],"contents":"Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States would commit up to $1 Billion in support for the Three Seas Initiative. In so doing, Congress and the administration are providing much needed assistance toward developing the economic and security infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe. This initiative, launched in 2015 by the Polish and Croatian presidents, aims to make Central Europe a “backbone of European resilience,” in the words of Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. If successful, the initiative will lead both to greater economic prosperity and interconnectedness with the rest of Europe, and will undercut Russian and Chinese pressure and influence.\nMore specifically, the Three Seas Initiative will correct infrastructural imbalance which runs on an almost entirely east-west axis. Old pipelines and highways primarily run east-west throughout Central Europe, once bringing Soviet oil and gas to Europe, and continuing to foster Europe’s reliance on Russian energy. By creating a north-south infrastructural axis, the Three Seas Initiative will break up what was once a Soviet tool of control and subjugation in Central Europe and support the development of energy, transportation, and even digital infrastructure in the region. This will create a more interconnected Europe, and a more self-sufficient Europe, or at very least a Europe with greater diversification of sources for all commodities.\nOne such project seeks to build a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal in Krk, Croatia, which would be connected to the existing terminals in Klaipėda, Lithuania and Świnoujście, Poland with north-south pipelines. This will reduce the reliance on Russian gas imports in the region, weakening the diplomatic leverage Russia enjoys. Also, and of particular importance to the Baltics, the Polish-Lithuanian gas interconnector (GIPL) project and synchronization of the Baltic power grid with Continental Europe are listed as priority projects. These will foster diversification of gas resources and bring the Baltic power grid out from Moscow’s control where it currently sits under the old Soviet-era BRELL Agreement. By improving energy security in the region and reducing reliance on Russian supply, the Three Seas Initiative is an investment in both collective and national defense as well as economic growth.\nA sample of Three Seas Initiative projects, plus TANAP and Nord Stream. Source: GISreportsonline.com\nIn the transportation sector, Rail Baltica is a key project for Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The project’s aim is to integrate the Baltics’ rail system with Continental Europe, and involves laying European gauge track in a north-south route from Tallinn to Warsaw, via Rīga and Kaunas and with a short connecting jaunt to Vilnius. This project will provide a rail connection to North Sea ports in Western Europe, and will reduce reliance on the highway system for cargo and freight transport. Not only will this improve the flow of goods and people in the region, but it will also change the operational landscape logistically for NATO in the event of conflict.\nIn tandem with Rail Baltica, improvements to the “Via Baltica” highway route are listed as a priority project under the Three Seas Initiative. Presently, freight transport accounts for approximately a 30 percent share of all traffic along the route, and in the case of Lithuania, 90 percent of all freight between Lithuania and the rest of Europe travels by road. Under the status quo, the road system is inadequate for demand in freight and passenger travel. Rail Baltica should alleviate some of the problem, but this corridor remains a critical artery for both commerce and defense. Upgrades, therefore, are a key interest for national security purposes as well, expediting movements of troops and supplies. Other transport projects, such as the Via Carpathia and a Baltic-Adriatic axis, will connect the Baltics to the Black Sea and Adriatic Sea, further erasing their relative isolation.\nFinally, with regard to digital infrastructure, the Three Seas Initiative includes projects on digital trade, research collaboration, and an ambitious plan to link communications infrastructure, fiber optics, and eventually 5G technology infrastructure, dubbed the “Three Seas Digital Highway.” 5G infrastructure is a major issue at stake here, as the Chinese are key competitors in the game, and there is grave concern that Chinese 5G systems will ultimately serve as tools of espionage and subversion. As such, investing in telecommunications and 5G infrastructure without going to the Chinese regime to buy it is prudent to protect security in the cyber-domain across the region.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the U.S. would pledge up to $1B for the Three Seas Initiative at the Münich Security Conference, February 2020. Photo Source: Atlantic Council, via Reuters.\nThe Three Seas Initiative consists of twelve members: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania. All twelve are EU members, and with the exception of Austria, each are part of NATO as well. From an American perspective, the initiative is an extremely positive development. As Atlantic Council’s Ian Brzezinski points out, supporting the Three Seas Initiative falls squarely within current American strategy, “[providing] justified support for some of America’s closest allies,” “[reinforcing] Central European efforts to counter malign Russian and Chinese pressure and influence,” and providing tangible return on investment for Washington’s foreign policy objectives in the region. Early on, Washington’s enthusiastic support for the project led to skepticism from some Western European EU members, but these have also come on board as well. And with regard to the EU, Austria is a key player from the perspective of the United States and the allies on NATO’s Eastern Flank. By joining the project, Austria is positioning itself to reduce dependence on Russia for energy and to increase its economic connections to European states in the East. This changes the balance of diplomatic leverage in Vienna, and will have an impact on positions it takes within the EU. Another friendly voice in EU institutions will certainly be welcome for members such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.\nBy connecting Central and Eastern Europe along a north-south axis, the Three Seas Initiative will enhance security and end a legacy of Soviet subjugation that still effects Europe today. It is a step in the right direction for ensuring stability, prosperity, and freedom for posterity. In short, it is a no-brainer for its member states and the U.S. alike.\nCover Photo: Three Seas Initiative member states.

Given that these two countries have a long tradition of close cooperation in military affairs, this seems fairly mundane. But these exercises were highly unusual, as Finland’s FNS Uusimaa took orders from Swedish naval command, and Sweden’s HMS Helsingborg received orders from Finland’s command center in Turku. This was the first time in the history of Finnish-Swedish naval cooperation that ships took orders from the opposite country’s command. While interoperability continues to be a buzzword throughout the Baltic Sea Region as countries prepare for scenarios of Russian aggression, switching commands remains uncommon, and indeed, questions about command structure abound.\nWhat, then, is the added value for this exercise? Anders Åkermark, representing the Swedish Naval Operations department, was quoted by News Now Finland saying, “it increases the credibility of both countries’ naval forces if we can lead each other’s vessels when needed and exchange information about the maritime situation.” This also parallels the idea that has been floating around of joint Finnish-Swedish brigades. In each case, Finland and Sweden have determined that pooling their resources will make their defenses more credible, deterring Russian attack.\nIn all maritime issues in the Baltic Sea Region, small countries’ limitations in manpower and financial resources present a key weakness. Even Finland and Sweden face the manpower gap, underscoring why both countries would seek to increase operability even so far as being able to take orders from the opposite command. The two, though they have long had amicable relations with NATO, are growing ever closer to the alliance and increasing cooperation with it. In the political realm, Sweden and Finland both are seeing a shift in attitude toward NATO membership as well. If Finland and Sweden were to join NATO, this would both facilitate cooperation on military operations throughout the Baltic Sea Region and bring the two ever closer to their partners in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\nSweden has increased cooperation with NATO in recent years. Photo source: nato.int\nIndeed, British military expert Glen Grant has argued that NATO should push for Finland and Sweden to join, as it would then legally obligate Stockholm and Helsinki to join the fight in the event of war in the Baltics. Apart from NATO, he argues, the two can be more easily cowed by Russia to stay out.\nOthers may argue that NATO accession for Finland and Sweden would be escalatory and prompt Russia to go on the attack. Though Russia would be expected to protest against NATO aggression in such an event, the reality is that NATO is a defensive alliance, and Russia’s fears are both baseless and, frankly little more that political grandstanding. Certainly Russia could use the usual line about NATO aggression as an excuse to go on the offensive, and as a tool to spin the narrative of just who started what, but it will nevertheless be a lie. Besides, in nuclear deterrence, there is the concept of “escalate to de-escalate,” raising the stake to the point where an adversary is less likely to deem the punishment worth the reward. The same applies here; two more militaries under NATO command, and all the manpower and weapons systems that go with it, will likely make Russia see merit in avoiding conventional conflict. Though hybrid warfare would likely intensify, the Baltic Sea Region is already a hotbed for such activity, and this would certainly be preferable to outright war anyhow.\nAs alluded to earlier, one of the key problems of joint operations and interoperability is the need for combatants to know just what is going on at any given moment. They need to know not only what the adversary is doing, but what their partners are doing. In order to do this, information sharing and situational awareness are critical. Throughout the Baltic Sea Region, nations are deficient in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the maritime domain. Likewise, the Baltic and Nordic countries need more flexible command and control structures and improved common coordination mechanisms to ensure the security of critical sea lines of communication and supply. These, too, will augment ISR needs, facilitating smoother operations. In all this, there is an implicit need for greater structural thinking both in national governments and among allies and strategic partners. Part and parcel of that, is the need for a cohesive and coherent strategy at the regional level to enhance and facilitate cooperation. Without structure and clearly defined roles and objectives, even the best laid plans descend into disaster.\nSwedish naval vessel HSM Helsinborg, as seen from Finnish naval vessel Uusimaa / Credit: Finish Navy, acessed via News Now Finland_\nAll this brings up yet another question: how far should countries go pursuing interoperability? You can, after all, have too much of a good thing. This question needs to be considered, especially with regard to added value. If Latvia purchases an inferior, outdated tank, Lithuania should not purchase the same tank just because the two could swap mechanics. Two broken down tanks are always worse than one operational one. But, if both countries can make joint procurements of a superior tank, this would both positively impact interoperability and operational effectiveness. As in all things, there is a balance, and this balance will always be different for small countries with limited manpower and financial resources than it is for say, the United States. Strategic, structural, and tactical thinking needs to be lucid and organized, and no facet should supersede another lest it fall to the wayside.\nGreater cooperation between Finland and Sweden on military affairs reflects a newfound seriousness about defense matters in Helsinki and Stockholm. These two are an integral part of military operations in the Baltic Sea theater, and as such, this news is welcome on NATO’s northeastern flank. An increase in the deterrent capacity of both countries changes the strategic calculus in the region. Even more so, NATO accession would radically alter the operational theater, and the possibility should be given thorough consideration. But this is not the end; maritime capabilities, structures, and strategies all need serious improvements throughout the region. Without these, all the interoperability in the world will not save them. Indeed, for all its benefits, allies and partners in the region need to find the right balance on interoperability. Governments throughout the region must be willing to keep improving, with both the aim to prevent war and be prepared for it should it come. Complacency kills.\nBy Matthew Thomas\nCover image: FNS Uusimaa, ShipSpotting.com\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/finland_sweden_naval_cooperation/","tags":["Finland","Sweden","Naval"],"title":"Interoperability at Sea"},{"categories":["Cooperation"],"contents":"At the end of last month, Lithuania and Poland announced that the two countries would each assign a brigade to NATO Headquarters in Poland to “train and act together” for the defense of the Suwałki Gap. According to the signed act of affiliation, Lithuania’s Iron Wolf Mechanized Brigade and Poland’s 15th Mechanized Brigade will train jointly to prepare for operations in the Gap, though they will remain under their own national command. The framework for this cooperation has its origins just over a year ago with the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Defense Council, and this is its first concrete act. This agreement will allow for greater cooperation on defense and security related matters, such as coordination of defense plans and joint exercises. Grand comparisons to 15th and 16th Century battles against the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Moscow and even to the Cold War era Fulda Gap aside, this new development in Polish-Lithuanian cooperation is quite welcome in a region widely considered to be a weak spot for NATO.\nThe Suwałki Gap is the narrow Polish-Lithuanian border region sandwiched between Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus. This area is of critical logistical importance to NATO, seeing as it is the only land border between the three Baltic States and the rest of the alliance. Presently, it contains only two minor highways running in a general north-south direction, as well as some smaller local roads and roads used by the logging industry and forest services. As such, it could serve as a tactical chokepoint, wherein Russian forces could stymie troop and supply movements north. Maintaining control over the Suwałki Gap, therefore, is critical in the event of war in the Baltic Theater with Russia.\nThe Suwałki region, however, presents major advantages for defense and significant obstacles for offensive operations. If NATO can deny Russia access, it will be that much more difficult for Russian troops to launch an offensive campaign there. If, on the other hand, NATO does not deny Russia access, and Russia gains control in the region, it will be extraordinarily difficult for NATO to reopen the critical corridor from Suwałki to Kaunas in order to supply operations in the Baltics.\nThe terrain is heavily forested and hilly, and is dotted with lakes, rivers, and marshes. Forests and lakes comprise approximately 50 percent of the land area, while swamps form another 11 percent. The hills run latitudinally and are intersected by rivers and lakes. Moraine dammed lakes are generally shallow, widely dispersed, and have soft embankments, while step, high banks and irregular bottoms characterize local ribbon lakes. Rivers in the region flow northward, and are generally narrow and winding, with steep and heavily forested banks. Many of the coniferous forests in the region are practically impassible, and most are inaccessible (or at least foolhardy) terrain. Clay and sandy clay soils in the region make for impassible conditions in rainy weather with deep, dense, and soggy mud. And indeed, rainy weather is typical for much of the year from the spring thaws all the way to autumn. In the wintertime, snow and frost inhibit movement. Snow covers the ground an average of 90 days per year, heavy frost an average of 50 days, and 30 days see ground frost temperatures. Soils are frozen approximately 120 centimeters deep in the winter, but frozen lakes and rivers may be crossable. Furthermore, the limited road system in the region is poor, and many bridges can only sustain a weight of about 50 tons, which will support a Russian tank, but not an American or British tank, as these average about 70 tons. Though there are pontoon bridges, these are few in number and not suitable for the local rivers. Besides weight limitations, these roads will not sustain movements of larger military vehicles in formation, meaning such equipment would either be forced to find alternate routes or would be “canalized” into long, slow lines or short caravans with limited numbers, nullifying any numerical advantage offensive forces might have.\nMap of the Suwałki region and its physical characteristics. Source: Col. Leszek Elak and Col. Śliwa, Zdzisław (ret.) “The Suwałki Gap – NATO’s Fragile Hotspot,” published in Zeszyty Naukowe AON nr 2. (103), 2016.\nThe regional terrain and climate are atypical, and local operations will require specialized training and equipment. These conditions readily benefit defensive operations by creating natural defensive lines and allowing armies to restrict movement with limited force, especially if road infrastructure is destroyed. Defenders in the region can further limit maneuverability in a number of ways, including creating engineering obstacles, developing camouflage and deception components to inhibit air and land reconnaissance, and establishing combat support and combat service assets locally. Further, the terrain itself limits the ability to reorganize combat units and restricts logistical support to react to changes in the tactical situation. On the other hand, the terrain supports covert operations. As a result of limited lines of sight and likely robust covert scouting operations, artillery is also limited in its usefulness for offensive operations in the Suwałki region.\nTypical forest wetland landscape near Augustów. Source: augustow.pl\nTwo key considerations must be brought up here: first, NATO can gain a serious tactical advantage by investing in early warning capabilities, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and facilitating information sharing in the region; second, Russia cannot close the Suwałki Gap without involving Belarus somehow. Regarding the first, it is blatantly obvious that NATO can better secure the region by investing in capabilities which enhance situational awareness, but the result of that investment is the key here: greater awareness allows greater time to surge forces into the theater, putting NATO in position to take advantage of a defensive posture in a local environment wholly suited for defense. The second is a little less obvious, as Kaliningrad is itself heavily militarized, while Belarus is less so. But, in order to effectively close the Suwałki Gap, Russia must deploy missiles over or from Belarus, or must deploy troops through Belarus, or less likely, coerce Belarus into joining the fight. Otherwise, a Belarusian route around the Gap remains open in a conventional war scenario. Such moves would escalate the situation to a point where strikes on Kaliningrad, Russian forces in Belarus, or even to the main part of Russia itself would be justified. Belarus, especially as relations currently stand, will be reasonably reluctant to allow any of the above scenarios, and NATO forces could theoretically hold local Russian assets at risk, turning the anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) balance in the region on its head against Moscow.\nThe Suwałki Gap presents both strategic challenges and strategic opportunities. If NATO can secure the Gap, it can maintain the vital overland supply line from Poland to the Baltics. Further, it can use the Gap to hamper Russian activities and capabilities around Kaliningrad and Belarus. From Polish acquisition of F-35 jets and Lithuanian acquisition of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs), to cooperation on the joint Polish-Lithuanian brigade to defend the Suwałki Gap, we have seen many positive measures for improving regional defense. But there is certainly more work to be done. It would be reasonable to expand the number of joint brigades; one probably is not enough. Secondly, infrastructural improvements are needed to ensure NATO tanks can cross bridges safely. NATO should invest in air defense and surveillance systems, and should seek to improve situational awareness locally in the Suwałki region. Finally, NATO needs to train and prepare for operations in the unique conditions the terrain, soil, climate, and infrastructure provide in order to improve overall readiness. As the only land route between the Baltics and the rest of NATO, this small piece of territory bears outsized significance for military operations in the Baltic theater. NATO must maintain it.\nBy Matthew Thomas\nCover photo: Polish-Lithuanian border Photo credit: Stratfor Worldview, worldview.stratfor.com\nSources:\nCol. Leszek Elak and Col.

A keen observer will notice that Alyaksandar Lukashenka’s Belarus is much the same. All too often, Western analysts have made the mistake of grossly oversimplifying Belarus’ relationship with Russia, as well as its domestic political affairs and broader foreign policy. This has led the West to neglect relations with Minsk, where despite a less than ideal government, great strategic opportunity lies, and where there is also significant strategic risk. The reality is this: Lukashenka is not simply Putin’s puppet in Minsk. He is concerned for his own nation’s sovereignty, and walks a thin tightrope in his relations with both Moscow and the West. Like him or not, there is no viable alternative to Lukashenka, and NATO needs a sovereign and neutral Belarus on the Baltics’ southeastern flank.\nRussia and Belarus have had extensive disagreements on economic matters. While Russia has largely been the economic lifeline for Minsk, and while Minsk has enjoyed huge subsidies on Russian gas, the special relationship between the two has largely gone sour. Arguments over energy prices, much of which center around the purported “oil tax maneuver,” in which Russia will reduce its “dotations” on Belarusian oil by lowering export duties while taxing resource extraction. This is estimated to result in critical losses to the Belarusian energy sector and will likely put significant strain on Belarus’ already weak economy. Likewise, Russia and Belarus have had major disagreements about the latter’s role in the Russian led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). In response, Lukashenka’s government has been seeking economic ties elsewhere, particularly China, the European Union, and Africa. Earlier this year, Lithuania and Poland were making overtures towards Minsk regarding trade in the energy sector, and Belarusian agricultural products reach E.U. markets regularly. However, a central pillar in Minsk’s future trade relations will most certainly be politics. Lukashenka sees too many political demands from both Russia and the E.U., and will increasingly seek to develop ties with the Chinese and with African nations such as Zimbabwe. Case in point, earlier this year Minsk began work on a deal to trade Belarusian heavy machinery for Zimbabwean diamonds and precious metals.\nPresident Lukashenka meets with Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, January 2019. Photo credit: president.gov.by\nBelarus’ relations with the West are just as complicated. Lukashenka has sought to balance cooperation with Western governments on the Northern Distribution Network during the war in Afghanistan and its role as a neutral mediator between Russia and Ukraine in the Minsk Accords against its staunch refusal to acquiesce to Western demands on democratic governance, human rights, and economic liberalization. From the American side, this has led to the imposition of sanctions on Belarus, along with numerous postponements of sanctions, and the two are only now ending an extended period of frosty diplomatic relations wherein Washington and Minsk did not exchange ambassadors.\nIn military affairs, Lukashenka’s tightrope becomes even more bizarre. While Russia and Belarus are friendly partners on paper, and while the two have enjoyed extensive military cooperation, notably in Russia’s Zapad (“West”) military exercises, Russia actively threatens Belarusian security. In response to Lukashenka’s gradual “soft-Belarusianization” and stubbornness on economic matters, Moscow has ramped up its campaign of hybrid warfare on Belarus, particularly with regard to disinformation. Further, many hardliners in the Russian political elite have called for a “Krymnash” (“Crimea is ours”) scenario for Belarus, wherein Belarus would be absorbed into the Russian state in much the same manner as Crimea. Even more, Russia has recently increased its troop presence in both Smolensk and Klintsy near the Belarusian border. Smolensk puts the Russians within a straight shot of Minsk by the E30 highway, along which there are few population centers to offer resistance. At Klintsy, the Russians are near the major Belarusian railway hub at Gomel’. This presence certainly increases the pressure on Minsk\nFor NATO, Belarus is a key strategic point on the Eastern Flank. A sovereign Belarus stands in the way of Russian aggression in the Baltic States. Should the Russians control Belarus, the Suwałki Gap, a narrow strip of land on the border of Lithuania and Poland between Belarus and Kaliningrad, could easily be sealed off, giving the Russians a key logistical advantage while denying land access to the Baltics by NATO reinforcements. Likewise, the current lack of Russian ground troops or air bases in Belarus is a key buffer between Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. By being de facto non-aligned, Belarus provides greater security on the Eastern Flank, allowing for continued NATO access to the Suwałki Gap. The strategic depth Belarus provides is clouded somewhat by its military and economic weakness should Russia decide to violate the former’s sovereignty, and this is precisely why relations with Minsk are taking on greater importance. Much as Western governments do not like the Lukashenka regime, and much as they are right not to, there are no viable alternatives that will maintain stability. The West, therefore, has to accept Lukashenka for who he is and encourage him to keep his country sovereign and neutral.\nCover Photo Credit: kremlin.ru\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/belarus_an_overlooked_key/","tags":["Belarus"],"title":"Belarus: An Overlooked Key to Baltic Security "},{"categories":["Monthly Reports"],"contents":"October 2019 has been busy for the Baltic Security Foundation, pursuing our goal of fostering and promoting Baltic defense and security. The team has both participated in and organized events covering regional security issues.\nThe Rīga Conference 2019 took place on October 11th and 12th. Mr. Olevs Nikers and Mr. Otto Tabuns were both invited to participate. The agenda included current challenges, such as the issue of EU and NATO identities as well as understanding European strategic autonomy. In a regional scope, the conference strongly emphasized the increasing importance of China and the Arctic region, and did not forget to keep Ukraine and Georgia on the agenda, too. Human rights and political power in the digital age formed another fundamental debate among the participants. In addition to the regular program, Mr. Tabuns was invited to moderate the Rīga Conference Future Leaders Forum that gathered 30 graduate students and young professionals from Europe, the U.S., and South Africa. They discussed the preconditions necessary for NATO to remain a relevant and modern alliance. The future leaders identified which NATO priorities are more important to them, personally, and worked on a set of recommendations for what the Alliance could do to obtain the necessary toolkit for it to succeed in the coming years. This is significant in understanding the certain different perspectives across the Transatlantic space, paving the way to common ground among the new generation of opinion and decision makers.\nBetween October 20th and 24th, BSF was honored to host Ms. Maia Otarashvili, a Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Eurasia Program at Foreign Policy Research Institute. She met the BSF team, as well as officials, diplomats, and scholars in Rīga. FPRI runs the Baltic Initiative, designed to advance Americans’ awareness of our region while providing a platform for voices from the region. The Initiative has launched a regular publication titled the Baltic Bulletin, which shares insights about the region with thousands of readers worldwide. The Initiative also organizes public events, and FPRI has supported the organization of AABS conference in Philadelphia. Therefore, Ms. Otarashvili’s visit is expected to strengthen networking between experts on the Baltic region across the Atlantic, especially beyond the Beltway in the U.S.\nOn October 23rd, BSF, in cooperation with BW Consulting, hosted another Baltic Sea Security Initiative Workshop in Berlin, Germany. Experts from Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States assessed the military aspects of Baltic Sea security. They devoted particular attention to the maritime and air domains, strategic and bureaucratic culture, national defense planning, and constitutional considerations. This will be used to formulate practical recommendations to Baltic and Allied decision makers.\nOn October 30th, BSF representatives were invited to participate in the Baltic Security Strategy Forum in Kiel. Hosted by the Institute of Security Policy by Christian Albrecht University in Kiel, the forum dealt with key regional issues in the maritime domain. The high level presenters, including many from the German, Swedish, and U.S. Navies, discussed Swedish-Finnish naval cooperation, gaps in Baltic naval cooperation with the rest of the NATO, and former Soviet naval offensive plans in the Baltic Sea in context of the Russian maritime strategy today.\nBy Otto Tabuns\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/regional_activities/","tags":["Germany","Poland"],"title":"Regional Activities"},{"categories":["Mobility"],"contents":"In October 2019, Baltic Security Foundation hosted Master of International Affairs students from Texas A\u0026amp;M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service for the Young Leaders Mobility Program in Rīga.

This second line would allow for additional gas flows directly from Russia to Western Europe up to a potential 110 billion cubic meters annually. At face value, this expansion is an economic opportunity that makes sense for Germany and other potential Western European customers. In a perfect world, it would be just that. Unfortunately, economic relations with Russia contain security risks. For precisely this reason, Nord Stream 2 faces opposition among Eastern European nations and the Baltic States, as well as from the United States. By cozying up to Russia for cheap gas, Germany is making a Faustian bargain that will not only endanger its allies to the east, but itself as well.\nRussia has long used energy supplies as a foreign policy tool. From the name of the Soviet-era Druzhba (“Friendship”) pipeline on up to Russia’s nearly annual cutting of Ukrainian gas supplies during the winter, it is clear that energy supply has been a key component of Moscow’s soft and hard power tactics alike. Likewise, in cases of “state capture,” the energy sector frequently plays a major role, as in Bulgaria. In Belarus, energy is front and center in disputes between Minsk and Moscow, as the latter seeks to coerce the former into falling in lock-step with the Kremlin’s policies and demands. For the Baltic States, the Soviet-era BRELL Agreement, which connects the electrical grids of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, and Russia synchronously, has given Moscow leverage since it controls the power supply. To their credit, the Baltic States have broken up Gazprom’s vertical monopoly in the regional gas market and have begun preparations to exit the BRELL Agreement, and these positive steps should serve as a model for others to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. But, as Europe’s dependence on foreign energy supplies continues to grow, many other European nations lack the political will to follow the Baltics’ lead, particularly those that do not share the threat perception evident in the east.\nEnergy has likewise served as a point of contention historically between the United States and the European allies. When Egypt, Jordan, and Syria attacked Israel during the 1967 Six Day War, the United States called upon the Europeans to support the Israelis. The Europeans, however, were not so keen to support Israel, even if they were sympathetic to the Israeli cause. For Britain, the decision to maintain a neutral, and even borderline pro-Arab stance, hinged on protecting its image among the Arab states in large part to secure oil supplies and retain Arab investment in British banks. In 2003, opponents of the Iraq War accused the United States of invading Iraq to secure its oil supplies, a refrain picked up by anti- American political leaders in Western Europe. Among these, Gerhard Schröder capitalized on the radical pacifism and anti-Americanism of the German left and excoriated the U.S. for Iraq, which he had previously supported. Now, Schröder, who has long been cozy with Putin, is Chairman of the Board for Nord Stream AG. This inspired the term Schroederizatsiya (“Schröderization”), which refers to the corruption of another country’s political elite. Alongside “state capture,” and often a key component of it, Schröderization is an important part of Russia’s broader hybrid warfare strategy.\nJust as in 2003, Germany and France once again are leading the anti-American bloc among the Europeans. These two are also united with the Kremlin on promoting the Steinmeier Formula for peace in Donetsk and Luhansk. Should the Steinmeier Formula be adopted in Ukraine, France and Germany would be responsible for legitimizing Russia’s actions not only in Ukraine, but in Georgia and Transnistria as well. With so little else in common with Russia, it is not difficult to ascertain that Germany and France have a vested interest in securing Russian energy supplies and are thus willing to side with the Kremlin against Ukraine, NATO allies along the Eastern Flank, and the United States.\nPhoto Credit: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\nWhat, then, does this all mean? Nord Stream 2, along with the southern Turk Stream route, will enable Russia to bypass old routes through Ukraine and Eastern Europe, ensuring a continuous stream of supply to Western European customers while at the same time denying that security to Eastern European nations that oppose Moscow. If Nord Stream 2 is completed, it will increase Western Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, giving Russia greater political and diplomatic leverage in its relations with those countries. While there has been much panic about divisions within NATO, the alliance has always experienced some disunity. But as many rush to defend the more complacent allies, such as Germany, they fail to realize the potential damage its recalcitrance may bring to the alliance. Though U.S. President Trump’s bluster may aggravate the Europeans, his administration has shown that in deed, the United States is hardly bent on retrenchment, and is in reality more committed to Europe than perhaps any other time since the Cold War. By cozying up to Russia on Nord Stream, however, Germany risks betraying its allies and increasing Russian influence at home. This dangerous policy alignment sets Germany down the path towards state capture and could do serious, lasting damage to NATO’s effectiveness as a defensive alliance.\nUnfortunately, what good news there was on stopping Nord Stream 2 took a decidedly negative turn this week. Along with U.S. sanctions on companies affiliated with Nord Stream, Denmark was holding up progress laying the pipeline through its territorial waters via its permitting process. The Danes have been key friends to the Baltic States since Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia regained independence in 1991. Unfortunately, Denmark approved the permits for Nord Stream 2 on Wednesday, October 30th. Should U.S. and other E.U. members’ efforts succeed in derailing Nord Stream 2, NATO can potentially avoid the situation outlined above. With Denmark’s efforts over, however, it is looking more and more bleak. Western Europe should seek instead to diversify its energy resources and where these resources come from. The Baltic model for greater self-sufficiency, coupled with American and South Korean partnerships on liquefied natural gas (LNG), serves as a potential pathway towards reducing dependence on Russian energy. Likewise, Poland has announced that it is cutting off Russian gas imports and instead turning towards the Norwegians, American LNG, and its own wells off the Norwegian coast. On energy, the Baltics and Poland serve as positive models to the rest of Europe: by reducing their dependence on Russian energy supplies, they remove political and diplomatic leverage from Moscow and reduce Russian influence on their governments. By choosing to pursue Nord Stream 2, however, Germany risks going the way of Bulgaria, where the energy sector is dominated by Gazprom and the political system now much more resembles that of Russia than when it first joined the European Union. Should Nord Stream 2 prevail, Germany will betray its allies and weaken the defensive alliance, dividing Europe between East and West once more.\nA single section of the pipeline remains incomplete around the Danish island of Bornholm, but Denmark approved the permits to build the pipeline on Wednesday, October 30. Photo credit: neftegaz.ru\u0026lt;\nFor the Baltic States, Nord Stream 2 is not an immediate threat to their energy supplies. They have greatly reduced their dependence on Russia in the energy sector. Their primary concern regarding Russia’s ability to cut off their energy supplies is not the route those supplies take, but the insecurity of their infrastructure, as many cables are unburied and unhidden, and many onshore components are poorly guarded, if at all. Nord Stream 2 is, however, a grave threat to the Baltic States’ broader security. Should Germany be a whole nation “Schröderized,” NATO will have a difficult time coping politically. Worse than that, though, NATO logistics will risk being completely thrown off track. While this scenario seems unlikely to come into fruition completely in the near-term, some aspects of the scenario will. The radical pacifism of Germany’s left and center, as well as growing anti-Americanism, open the door for Russian influence in government. Increased dependence on Russian energy will open that door wider, making Germany an even weaker link in NATO than it already is. Many Western European nations that do not have such heightened threat perception with regard to Russia, and that have a greater affinity towards the German-led European Union over NATO, will be tempted to follow Germany’s lead. For Russia, a weakened NATO is an opportunity. For the Baltics, a weakened NATO is an existential threat.\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/stopping_nord_stream/","tags":["Nord Stream 2"],"title":"Why Stopping Nord Stream 2 Matters for the Baltics"},{"categories":["Maritime Policy"],"contents":"Maritime operations have once again been a major theme of recent headlines in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Following the NATO BALTOPS exercises this summer, repeated violations of the Baltic States’ airspace by Russia, and observing current combat diving operations in Tallinn Bay, maritime security issues are particularly relevant. Unfortunately, given the long-standing emphasis on land-based deterrence, the maritime domain has largely been neglected.\nBALTOPS 2019 revealed a key weakness for naval operations: the shallow and largely unmarked coastline hampered amphibious landing operations in Lithuania. Not only do these conditions make amphibious landing operations slower and more difficult, they even present major operational hazards. One Polish landing vessel reportedly ran aground during the exercises. While there is not much that can be done about shallow water, Lithuanian and U.S. forces have responded to these weaknesses by conducting coastal observation studies and exploring the seabed along the Lithuanian coast. Given that the Baltic States’ only land border with the rest of the alliance is the narrow Suwałki Gap on the Polish- Lithuanian border, NATO cannot rely on land connections for logistical support. As such, the ability to conduct amphibious landings with troops and supplies is vital.\nIt would be wonderful if a poorly marked coastline and shallow water were the only deficiencies in the Baltic States’ maritime defense. Unfortunately, the Baltic States lack the ability to prevent Russia from projecting power into their territorial waters, port facilities, exclusive economic zones, and other littoral areas. Furthermore, the Baltic States cannot prevent Russia from temporarily taking control of these areas. The Russian Baltic Sea fleet may not be overly large or impressive, but it is more than capable of maintaining the status quo, harassing military and civilian activity at sea, and taking surprise offensive action. After all, Russian naval harassment is not unknown – Lithuanian sailors laying the NordBalt cable were repeatedly antagonized by Russian ships – and grey zone operations are a key component of Russian strategy.\nThis situation only gets worse. The Baltic States are currently deficient in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities at sea. They do not have full, integrated, and shared awareness across the surface, subsurface, and air domains. Individual states’ capabilities vary, but Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are all deficient at ISR in the maritime domain given the context of their current security environment. Likewise, the Baltic States have had varying levels of success with sharing information. As it stands, there is no full-time command center to process threats at sea and determine how to respond. The multiple recent violations of Baltic airspace by Russian military aircraft underscores the importance of ISR capabilities and information sharing between the Baltic States. In order to process and respond to threats, one first must know that they are there.\nYet more bad news: the maritime domain hosts several key components of the Baltic States’ critical energy and communications infrastructure. Undersea cables, gas interconnectors, and onshore facilities such as the Klaipėda LNG terminal are all vulnerable to attack. Many cables are unburied and unhidden, such as the NordBalt cable, which connects the Baltic and Nordic electricity markets. Likewise, many other infrastructural components are poorly guarded, if at all. These components create key weaknesses for Russia to exploit in the event of an attack. Cutting off gas or electricity supply will likely wear down societal resilience to propaganda, and will complicate military logistics and decision making as well.\nWith such a heavy focus over the last several years on land-based deterrence, the Baltic States have largely neglected the maritime domain. CPT Bill Combes (U.S. Navy, retired) refers to this condition as “sea-apathy,” and it has led to gaps in procurement, awareness, capabilities, and strategy. Many experts, such as Combes, have provided excellent suggestions to improve the situation. The author makes no attempt to claim the following recommendations as his own, but has selected those from other experts that he has deemed most practical and actionable:\nFirst: the Baltic States need to develop clear goals and a comprehensive maritime strategy. This strategy should identify important investments required for robust maritime domain awareness.\nSecond: in order to reduce costs and improve interoperability, the Baltic States should identify opportunities for joint procurements in maritime ISR technology.\nThird: the Baltic States need to implement a combined and cooperative Naval Operations Center in order to best focus individual maritime capabilities to mutual benefit and facilitate higher-end NATO operations. Further, the Baltic States should establish a joint Maritime Command Center which could identify and process threats and determine how best to respond.\nFinally: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia all need to focus on becoming effective “coastal powers,” as Combes calls it. Their navies do not need to be large and grandiose, but they do need to be able to protect infrastructural assets, trade, and communication in the maritime domain.\nThe current situation in the maritime domain is most certainly not ideal. However, it can be improved by taking practical steps like those outlined above and participating in ongoing NATO training exercises. The coast is a key component of the Baltic States’ security both in peace-time and in the event of war. As such, “sea-apathy” cannot remain a feature of the Baltic States’ defense posture.\nBy Matthew Thomas\nCover Photo: BALTOPS 2019 / Benas Gerdžiūnas / LRT\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/improving_maritime_security/","tags":["Naval","Maritime"],"title":"Improving the Baltic States’ Maritime Security"},{"categories":["Conference"],"contents":"BSF President Mr. Olevs Nikers and BSF Director Mr. Otto Tabuns took part in the panel “Addressing Security Challenges in the Baltic Region through Multilateral Cooperation” of the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) 13th General Conference September 5, 2019 in Wrocław, Poland.\nDuring his presentation “Sub-Regional Defense Synchronization – Theory Perspectives and Security Expectations for the Baltics,” Mr. Nikers outlined and discussed the origin and sustainability of the modern security alliance between small countries. He focused on the Baltic States, and took the issue of alliance formation beyond the realm of Cold War-era power balancing, upon which the main alliance- building theory was formed.\nFrom one side, the presentation discussed current issues regarding the Baltic States’ security cooperation, which were identified and analyzed within the Baltic Security Strategy Project (2018-2019) by scholars and government professionals from the Baltic States. From the other side, the panel examined traditional and modern theoretical perspectives, answering the question of whether small states are capable of boosting their defenses and enhancing deterrence by synchronizing their security and improving military interoperability within the collective security system.\nThe 13th ECPR General Conference took place in Wrocław September 4-7, 2019.

Since regaining independence after the illegal Soviet occupation, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all become deeply integrated into Western institutions, such as NATO and the EU. These small countries, understanding the potential peril of reoccupation by a resurgent Russia after the annexation of Crimea, have been extremely vocal in sounding the alarm that Russia remains a security threat. They understand that the West must get serious about security lest its more vulnerable members once more get trampled.\nThirty years ago this month, the Baltic States sent Gorbachev a clear message by forming a massive, 2 million member human chain from Tallinn, Estonia all the way to Vilnius, Lithuania. This show of resolve, known as the Baltic Way, demonstrated that the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian patriots would not be suppressed in their push for independence from Communist tyranny. This large- scale, peaceful popular protest was a remarkable event within the broader miracle of 1989 in Eastern Europe, and has today inspired the people of Hong Kong to make their own “Hong Kong Way.” But, as we in the West celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way, let us not forget the 80th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the danger posed by ambitious neighbors.\nThe Baltic States’ geographic situation is an unfortunate one. They are largely cut off by land from their NATO allies, their terrain has few natural barriers to an invading force, and the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet operates to the Baltic States’ north and south in St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad. The Suwałki Gap, a narrow strip of land on the border of Lithuania and Poland, constitutes the only land border between the Baltic States and the rest of NATO. This tiny strip with two highways lies between Belarus and Kaliningrad, meaning that Russia could easily seal it off, making a logistical nightmare for NATO to come to the Baltics’ aid. At sea, the Russian Navy is not particularly impressive, but is more than capable of harassing ships and conducting grey zone operations on infrastructure and the port and supply chains.\nThis unfortunate geographic situation, combined with Russian military buildup in the Western Military District and Russia’s propensity to meddle in its neighbors’ affairs, makes Baltic Security of vital importance to NATO. As things currently stand, Russia prefers to stay below the threshold of conventional war, knowing that its conventional forces may have a short-term advantage, but that in the long-run, NATO forces are superior. As such, Russia seeks to destabilize the political situation through hybrid means, such as misinformation/disinformation, economic capture, the use of proxy groups as an element of “aktivnye meropriyatiya” (“active measures”) in intelligence operations, and cyber-attacks. By utilizing hybrid warfare against the spectrum of a state’s governmental and societal functions, Russia economizes the use of force and is able to continuously adjust the intensity of conflict. It is important to remember that Russia views itself in conflict with NATO, even though the two are not locked in conventional war.\nAs the situation stands now, Russia is probably unlikely to conduct conventional military operations against the Baltic States. Its economy cannot sustain this kind of war, and it is currently mired in other theaters. Nevertheless, Russia will absolutely continue its hybrid efforts against Baltic society and government, as it seeks to undermine Western influence and restore the Baltic States to its sphere of influence. Indeed, Russia successfully annexed Crimea without firing a shot using a comprehensive package of hybrid tactics, perhaps most famously the “little green men” at a time when it viewed Western leadership as weak and feckless. NATO leadership must remain strong and resolute against the Russian threat, and Western European leaders need to understand that they have a moral imperative to defend their own people as part and parcel of their obligation to NATO. A Russian attack on the Baltic States will inevitably test Article 5 (the principle of “an attack on one is an attack on all”), upon which NATO’s credibility hangs. Likewise, the Baltic States must continue to make strides on societal security, infrastructural security (including energy security), financial security, cyber-security, and defense/deterrence. The work being done in the region is good, and needs to continue in order to maintain freedom in the Baltics.\nFrom the “Year of Terror” in 1941 to re-independence in 1991, the Baltic States suffered under tyranny. For Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, national security is a matter of state survival. Freedom is vulnerable, and must be guarded with vigilance and enthusiasm. Russia must be taken seriously: all too often, the political discourse in the U.S. and Europe recognizes the threat that Russia poses, but fails to understand the nature of Russian tactics. Likewise, many political groups seek to associate their opponents with Russia, while ignoring Russian influence on their own parties, undermining faith in democratic institutions and doing the Russians’ work for them. For NATO, Baltic security is a matter of credibility. If the Baltic States fall and NATO does not respond, the alliance will no longer be taken seriously, and its defense will be undermined. For the United States, it is a matter of both credibility and affinity – the U.S. seeks to defend liberty in the face of tyranny wherever it exists. An aggressive Russia not only threatens security in Europe, but also threatens security in the U.S. After all, Russia seeks to undermine American political stability as well. In geopolitics, everything is interconnected, and the U.S. and Europe cannot afford to neglect any region, especially not the Baltics.\nPhoto Credit: US Embassy, Latvia\nCover Photo: NATO (nato.int)\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/is_baltic_security_important/","tags":["NATO","Europe","Important","US"],"title":"Is Baltic Security Important for the U.S., NATO, and Europe? Absolutely!"},{"categories":null,"contents":" The Baltic Security Foundation (BSF), established in 2019, promotes the security and defense of the Baltic Sea region. The Foundation is a result of the Baltic Security Strategy Project (2017-2019) that gathered experts on defence, societal security and economic security to assess the shared challenges for the Baltic States and recommend solutions. BSF gathers Baltic experts and security experts from the region and beyond. It provides a platform for discussion and research, expert networking, expert mobility, and promotes finding and advocating for solutions that lead to a stronger regional security in military and other areas.  \nHistory In 11 July 2019, the Baltic Security Foundation (BSF) was officially established by Mr. Olevs Nikers, President of the BSF and Mr. Otto Tabuns, Director. The goal of the BSF is to promote and foster Baltic regional defense and security. Thirty years ago, on August 23, 1989, two million Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians joined hands in the Baltic Way human chain. Their common deliberation paved the way to regaining Baltic independence. Today, the three Baltic States stand strong. However, many find that so much more could be done by speaking in one, stronger voice. This is especially the case in regard to security and the three Baltic expert communities. This is one of the key conclusions of the Baltic Security Strategy Project, which was led by Mr. Olevs Nikers and Mr. Otto Tabuns (February 2018 – March 2019) – the largest independent Baltic security cooperation projects involving regional stakeholders from across the board. Common security is predicated on common expertise that requires strategic thinking and a systematic approach. Current analytic structures in each Baltic state are limited by human resources and funding to implement systematic medium and long-term regional strategic analysis, representing the region in one voice. Intraregional cooperation of scholars and professionals on the matters of their region is incidental. E.g. the Baltic Security Strategy Project was unique in its nature, gathering security experts – scholars and professionals from the Baltic countries within a single cooperation endeavor. There is also lack of a single pool of expertise, gathering the contact information and the material of work of the most notable regional field experts. An umbrella organization is needed to do just that, therefore strengthening the think tanks and other research organizations across the Baltic countries. The objectives of BSF are to:\n 1. Raise awareness of Baltic defense and security matters among allied and regional partners, 2. Organize and facilitate Baltic security expert cooperation through designated instruments of financial and administrative support, 3. Provide and facilitate Baltic security policy analysis and advice for Baltic and Allied stakeholders, 4. Foster Baltic security and defense synchronization through discussion and legislation, 5. strengthen local Baltic expertise and raise national think tank capacity.  The BSF works as a cluster of Baltic defense and security experts, professionals and think tanks, organizing activities that involve at least three Baltic states, and as an instrument for attraction of financial resources to maintain and facilitate activities which support Objectives of the BSF. The primary focus of the BSF activity is the Baltic Sea region within the Euro Atlantic framework. It is a non-profit organization which operates on the concluding cooperation agreements with Baltic think tanks and individual experts. Partnership is open for all governmental and private institutions, as well as individual experts that support the goal and objectives of the BSF. Anyone who shares the goals and objectives of the BSF — individual experts and organizations within the region and beyond — is welcome to partner with BSF! BSF membership will grant access to our network of Baltic defense and Security experts and Organizations and priority to be engaged in our activities and Projects as agreed and (2) Individual Members and Organizations are eligible to apply for any support from BSF available - to implement activities/Projects etc., which supports Goal and Objective of the BSF or (3) provide moral support to BSF mission, which is also necessary for demonstration of our unity and coherence and will help to succeed Goal and Objectives of the BSF.
